      "The 'Threat of Substitute Products' section shifts focus to the MLOps market for SMBs, which is incongruous with the broader FinTech context and disrupts logical coherence.",
      "In the 'Threat of New Entrants' section, the claim that the threat is high conflicts with the description of strong incumbent advantages, creating a contradictory argument.",
      "Repeated phrasing across sections (e.g., strategic recommendations to enhance loyalty, tiered pricing, and partnerships) leads to redundancy and reduces the perceived novelty of each section.",
      "Several sentences are overly long and contain multiple clauses, making them difficult to parse and affecting sentence-level readability.",
      "Transitions between sections are minimal, causing a slightly choppy flow despite the overall logical structure."
