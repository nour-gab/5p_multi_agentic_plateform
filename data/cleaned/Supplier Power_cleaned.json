In recent years, companies in the financial sector have had to deal with the challenges of a changing interest rate environment. For the most part, they have coped well with this. However, during this time, the economy weakened and geopolitical conflicts increased. 2025 could be even more challenging. Economic risks could place an even greater burden on banks' loan books and insurers' investment portfolios. These challenges are compounded by growing political uncertainty and the increasingly digital nature of geopolitical tensions and conflicts. The number of government-initiated cyberattacks on critical infrastructure companies, which includes companies in the financial industry, is rising. Such attacks can seriously jeopardise financial stability. This is in part because companies in the financial sector are increasingly outsourcing IT services – and are relying on only a small number of service providers. This results in risky dependencies and market concentration. Companies must be prepared for these and other developments. BaFin is also preparing itself: it analyses the risks for all market participants and consumers on a continuous basis and reacts accordingly. The present “Risks in BaFin’s Focus 2025” report is BaFin’s fourth annual compilation of the risks that are most capable of jeopardising the financial stability or the integrity of the financial markets in Germany. This year, we will be focusing our attention primarily on these risks. In 2025, we will focus on six risks in particular: Risks arising from corrections on the real estate markets ⇨ Risks arising from significant corrections on the international financial markets ⇨ Risks arising from corporate loan defaults ⇧ Risks arising from cyber incidents with serious consequences ⇧ Risks arising from inadequate money laundering prevention ⇨ Risks arising from market concentration due to the outsourcing of IT services ⇧ For the first time, we are not including interest rate risks in this list. This is because an upward interest rate shock has become less likely due to the current interest rate level at the beginning of 2025 and the development of inflation. The increased interest rate risks of the past have largely been minimised. The order of the risks does not reflect their prioritisation. The trend arrows indicate the future development (increasing, constant, decreasing) BaFin is anticipating. The specific steps BaFin will take to mitigate these six major risks are detailed in the individual risk descriptions. In addition to the six major risks, the way in which the companies under BaFin’s supervision deal with longer-term trends will also be significant. These include digitalisation, geopolitical upheavals and sustainability. As in previous years, it should be noted that not all of the scenarios described in this “Risks in BaFin’s Focus 2025” report will materialise, and new risks may emerge. BaFin looks to identify such emerging risks at an early stage and react quickly. More articles Risks in BaFin's Focus 2025 Main Risks in BaFin’s Focus 1.

Risks arising from corrections on the real estate markets → The commercial and residential real estate markets have been under pressure since mid-2022. Some commercial real estate risks have materialised. In some cases, this has resulted in considerable value adjustments and write-downs on exposures at certain banks and insurers. The strained situation on the German commercial real estate market, which includes commercial residential real estate, persisted in 2024. This was increasingly evident in the rising numbers of non-performing loans (NPLs) at German banks, at both significant institutions ( SIs ) and less significant institutions ( LSIs ). From mid-2024, there were clear signs of a decline in risk on the residential real estate market. Commercial real estate Overall, the risks to financial stability posed by the commercial real estate market remain elevated. While these risks alone are not expected to jeopardise the functioning of the financial system, individual institutions can be heavily burdened by major loan defaults in their portfolios. The German and US real estate markets are particularly important for companies supervised by BaFin . Banks that are focused on financing commercial real estate and that may be unable to compensate for losses in this segment through other business areas, as well as project developers, are therefore exposed to increased risk due to their specific business models. Price declines halted for now, new business continues to falter Commercial real estate loans are highly important for the German banking sector. In 2024, they accounted for over 9% of the aggregate total assets of German banks. Prices for office and retail real estate, as measured by the vdp Property Price Index, fell by around 17% between mid-2022 and the third quarter of 2024, while prices for commercial residential real estate decreased by around 8%. Since the beginning of 2024, the price trend has recovered somewhat from a very low level. However, a stable trend is yet to be observed and the commercial real estate market remained fragile at the end of 2024 (see Figure 1).

V., as at 26 November 2024 Transaction volume and new lending business remain at a low level In 2024, weak economic growth, high interest rates, high construction costs and persistently high core inflation placed a burden on the German commercial real estate market. In addition, the increase in working from home and the growth in onl",

For over 20 years, an annual highlight at this time of the year is the release of the Saxo Bank Outrageous Predictions. This year is no exception. John Hardy has been at the bank and involved in the annual predictions since the series launched. The predictions are always fun-and one can always expect the unexpected. There is one notable recurring theme over the years. The bank examines scenarios that could reshape the financial markets as we know them. They do not represent Saxo Bank’s official market forecasts but here is the serious bit. Each year, the predictions serve as courageous, thought provoking, reminders for investors to account for all possible outcomes-even those that appear unlikely. And take note: often it is the outrageous that moves the market. This year, there are eight predictions and it is a safe bet that if they were to occur, they would send varying degrees if shockwaves across the financial markets. “The Saxo Outrageous Predictions are not exactly news and not exactly real—at least not yet. While we don’t know which stories will drive the global economy in the coming year, our 2025 predictions, from Nvidia trouncing its Mag 7 peers to the fall of OPEC, from a bold bet on reflation in China to a great leap forward in biotech, are just as promised: outrageous,” says Hardy.

In another evolving trend throughout the year, wealth managers continued to invest in developing digital platforms to better connect with their next-gen clients and also service the entry-level high-net-worth (HNW) client segment more cost-efficiently. Steps have also been taken to integrate AI into advisory for efficiency gains initially with a larger ambition of providing customised advice at scale. In 2024, we also saw numerous private banks and wealth managers expanding their offerings and propositions with an ESG focus. This is in response to a strong and ongoing trend of UHNW clients and family offices incorporating ESG into their overall philosophy and mandates. It is likely to gain further momentum with the ongoing inter-generational wealth transfer over the next several years. One key trend in 2024 has been the continuing shortage of quality talent in Asia and Middle East. There has been a rise in demand for Relationship Managers (RMs) in these regions as many private banks are looking to grow their assets. With the entry of some new private banks in the Middle East market, the supply of quality talent has remained static, creating barriers to growth and straining cost-to-income ratios in the region. Another key trend in 2024 has been the continued growth of the Independent Asset Management (IAM) sector, which has further exacerbated the talent shortage for traditional private banks. Private banks lost some high-performing RMs in 2024, who either set up their own or joined existing IAMs during the year. Forecasts anticipated for 2025 in private banking In terms of market sector trends, the Middle East should continue to experience strong growth and lead the league tables for the net inflow of HNW and UHNW families in 2025. This growth trend is likely to be sustained beyond 2025, as wealthy families and businesses are attracted by factors such as quality of life, personal safety, political stability, rapidly maturing financial infrastructure, and a compelling tax regime. The introduction of the Golden Visa and continuing liberalisation have been game changers in accelerating millionaire migration to the UAE. Further, factors such as adverse changes in the UK tax regime will continue to support these trends in 2025. In terms of investment preference trends, we have already seen rapid growth in private clients’ interest in alternative assets. We expect this trend to accelerate during 2025 as private clients are more open to allocating (to alternatives) with the prospect of higher returns and more liquidity. On the other hand, alternative asset managers are investing in developing products more suited to private wealth clients and expanding wealth distribution channels to tap into the faster-growing private wealth pools. We expect wealth managers to expand their alternative product suites and recommend higher allocations to alternatives in their strategic asset allocation models during 2025 in response to these structural growth drivers. We also expect wealth managers to increase their focus on the looming inter-generational wealth transfer in 2025. This will likely be a mix of strategies including organising next-gen events, further digitalising the wealth management jo",

Security breaches can have significant financial and reputational consequences. Moreover, building trust with customers is vital in the financial sector. These companies may face scepticism from customers who are used to traditional financial institutions. These factors are anticipated to restrict the market growth in the coming years.

The investment will support the companyâs plans to accelerate global growth, scale operations and expand its commercial reach and product portfolio. Founded in 2012, Dreampath offers a patented suite of traceability solutions and consumables designed to automate and digitally transform the archiving and retrieval of tissue samples in pathology labs. Today, the company manages more than 250 million samples across over 500 labs in nearly 40 countries, serving a broad range of healthcare organizations, from hospitals and research institutions to commercial laboratories and cancer centers. âPathology labs are a critical part of the global healthcare ecosystem, yet many still rely on manual, error-prone processes for sample archiving and retrieval,â said Pablo Jordan, CEO and co-founder of Dreampath Diagnostics. âOur mission is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of these workflows through automation and digital traceability, allowing labs to provide patients with faster and safer diagnostics. Weâre proud to partner with Summit to help us scale our impact and reach more patients around the world.â Dreampathâs integrated platform is protected by more than 80 patents worldwide and is designed to automate, simplify and streamline lab workflows to help eliminate the risk of patient sample loss.
