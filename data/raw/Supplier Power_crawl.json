In this podcast we discuss a wide range of topics from wholesale CBDC projects, cryptocurrencies and a lot more from the optic of a regulated digital asset platform.\r\n\r\nWhat is blockchain?\r\nThe first time Michele was explained what is blockchain was in 2014/15. At that time it was described to him as an append only data structure. It's an Excel where you never can delete a row, you can only add them, but you can look up whatever you wrote before and what other people wrote before it. It has a chatter effect where you have to validate what is heard by the participants in a “room”.\r\nIn terms of how it applies to the financial industries, it comes down to the ledger, the compression of the ledger, intermediaries and malicious actors onto a network and how the validation of the blocks would work.\r\n\r\nSIX and SDX\r\nSIX is the financial market infrastructure of Switzerland. SIX operates the infrastructure for the Swiss and Spanish financial centres. The BME (Bolsa de Madrid), the stock exchange of Spain, was acquired by SIX in 2020. SIX runs the CSD, central securities depository, in Spain, the clearing house called X-Clear and the listed exchange.\r\nMichele describes, SDX as a bet that SIX took a few years ago to start capitalising on the blockchain revolution. There was a recognition that SIX needed to prepare itself for this digital revolution of digital assets and crypto currencies hitting the traditional FMI space. SDX was built to cater for this new business, of both crypto and digital securities by creating a kind of CSD on blockchain to tokenise those digital regulated securities.\r\nIn September 2021, FINMA, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority issued two approvals to operate financial market infrastructures based on blockchain. Specifically, FINMA has authorized SIX Digital Exchange AG to act as a central securities depository and the associated company SDX Trading AG to act as a stock exchange. This was the first time that a licence has been issued in the Swiss financial centre for infrastructures that facilitate the trading of digital securities in the form of tokens and their integrated settlement. This proved that you can build a CSD under a specific regulatory regime, using a private DLT\r\nThis allows for atomic settlements, trading and settling at the same time, and for smart contract enablement.\r\nIn November 2021, SIX issued its own dual tranche bond to fund the M&A transaction to acquire BME. The CHF 150m ($162m) bond was composed of a CHF 100m digital bond listed on SDX and CHF 50 million conventional bond listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. The splitting of that bond in this manner was voted by the participants. The bond was oversubscribed and the rating was equal across the two channels.\r\n\r\nWholesale CBDC projects\r\nSDX participated in two wholesale CBDC projects. Project Helvetia, was conducted by SND, the Swiss National Bank, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), SIX/SDX and 5 commercial banks. The project looked at introducing a Digital Swiss Franc as a CBDC in Switzerland.\r\nProject Jura, the second wholesale CBDC project involved Banque de France, BIS, SDX and the Swiss National Bank. The project aimed       to enable instant settlement of foreign currency transactions as payment versus payment (PvP) and the use of wholesale CBDC to pay for tokenized commercial paper transactions as delivery versus payment (DvP) with immediate settlement. The project also aimed to explore how cross border central bank movements of assets and money would work.\r\nIt looked at the concept of DvP, of commercial paper, in this case issued under French law against a Euro CBDC and then a PvP of that Euro CBDC versus the Swiss Franc CBDC. So, a transfer of assets versus cash and then cash versus cash. <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mcurtoni/\">Michele Curtoni</a> heads the strategy and new business development at SDX, SIX’s regulated digital asset exchange platform, which is part of the <a href=\"https://www.six-group.com/en/home.html\">SIX Financial Group</a>, the financial market infrastructure of Switzerland.

All topics Money Money World currency symbols: a complete guide to global money signs and codes From $ to Â¥ to â¿ - discover the stories, symbols, and codes behind the worldâs money in this complete, easy-to-read guide to global currencies. Read more In our interconnected global economy, currency symbols are everywhere, whether you're planning international travel, running an e-commerce business, formatting financial documents, or simply trying to understand pricing on a foreign website. Knowing how to recognise and use currency symbols correctly is essential. The long and the short of it is that currency symbols are shorthand notations that represent different monetary units around the world.Â Unlike ISO currency codes (like USD or EUR), these symbols provide a quick visual reference that transcends language barriers. From the familiar dollar sign ($) to the Indian rupee symbol (â¹), each symbol tells a story of economic identity and cultural significance. Understanding currency symbols becomes particularly important when dealing with international transactions, creating multilingual websites, formatting invoices, or developing financial applications. They're not just academic knowledge - they're practical tools for anyone engaged in global commerce or travel. What is a currency symbol? A currency symbol is a graphical representation used to illustrate a specific monetary unit. These symbols serve as universal shorthand, allowing people to quickly identify and work with different currencies without needing to spell out the full currency name or remember complex three-letter codes. For example, the dollar sign ($) immediately signals US dollars, while the euro symbol (â¬) represents the European Union's currency. The British pound uses (Â£), and the Japanese yen employs (Â¥). Each symbol has been carefully designed to be distinctive and memorable. It's important to distinguish currency symbols from ISO currency codes. While the symbol for US dollars is $, the ISO code is USD. The symbol for euros is â¬, but the ISO code is EUR. Symbols are visual and compact, while codes are standardised three-letter abbreviations used primarily in financial systems and international banking. Currency symbol placement rules (before or after the number?) The placement of currency symbols relative to numbers varies significantly across countries and cultures, following local conventions rather than universal rules. In most English-speaking countries, the symbol appears before the number: $100, Â£50, or A$75 for Australian dollars. However, many European countries place the symbol after the number: 100â¬ in France, or 50â½ in Russia. Some currencies have unique formatting conventions. In Cape Verde, you might see 20$00, where the dollar sign appears before the decimal portion. Similarly, some Latin American countries write $20.00 or $20,00 depending on their decimal separator conventions. When working with international documents or websites, always research the local convention for the specific country and currency you're dealing with. This attention to detail demonstrates cultural awareness and professionalism in global business c",
