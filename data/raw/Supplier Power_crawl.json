It’s one of the core components of Porter’s Five Forces framework, a tool widely used to analyze competitive dynamics and craft winning business strategies. Supplier power can shape entire industries, impacting profitability, pricing strategies, and operational flexibility. Let’s break down what supplier power entails, how it works, and how modern trends amplify or mitigate its effects. What is Supplier Power? Supplier power refers to the leverage suppliers have in negotiating prices, terms, and conditions with buyers. High supplier power can erode profitability by driving up costs or imposing unfavorable terms, while low supplier power gives buyers more control. Factors influencing supplier power include: Number of Suppliers : Fewer suppliers mean higher power. Uniqueness of Offerings : Proprietary technologies or specialized products boost supplier leverage. Switching Costs : High costs to switch suppliers give suppliers more control. Forward/Backward Integration Threats : Suppliers that can bypass you or your ability to do the same change the balance of power. Importance of Buyers : If your business constitutes a significant portion of the supplier’s revenue, you gain leverage. Key Dimensions of Supplier Power Here are the critical factors to assess supplier power in your industry: 1.    Input Prices and Cost Control What are the costs of key inputs? How sensitive are your suppliers to input cost changes? Suppliers with significant control over scarce or essential materials can raise prices without much pushback, especially if alternatives are unavailable. Supply chain disruptions caused by events like the pandemic or geopolitical tensions have made raw materials like semiconductors and lithium critical bottlenecks, drastically increasing supplier power in certain sectors. 2.    Switching Costs How easy is it for you to change suppliers? High switching costs, due to factors like proprietary systems or longterm contracts, give suppliers the upper hand. Conversely, low switching costs increase buyer leverage. Digital platforms and procurement technologies like blockchain are reducing switching costs, enabling buyers to source globally with more transparency and ease. 3.    Supplier Revenue Dependency What percentage of a supplier’s revenue comes from your business? Suppliers that heavily rely on your business are more willing to negotiate favorable terms to retain your account. Consolidation among buyers in industries like retail and automotive is tipping the scales, giving buyers more power by representing a larger share of supplier revenues. 4.    Unique Resources or IP Do suppliers possess proprietary technologies, patents, or unique resources? Suppliers with exclusive rights to critical IP or resources wield substantial influence, particularly in industries like biotech or technology. Technologies like AI and green energy solutions often reside with a few pioneering suppliers, enhancing their negotiating power. 5.    Forward or Backward Integration Threats Is there a risk of suppliers entering your market (forward integration)? Or can you vertically integrate (backward integration)? Suppliers that can eliminate intermediaries or become direct competitors can significantly shift the power dynamic. Conversely, companies investing in backward integration e.g., sourcing their own raw materials diminish supplier power. Companies like Tesla have adopted backward integration by investing in battery raw materials, reducing reliance on external suppliers. 6.    Capacity Utilization and Availability Are suppliers operating at full capacity? Or do they have spare capacity? Suppliers with limited capacity have more power to dictate terms, while excess capacity creates opportunities for negotiation. Capacity utilization is a critical factor, with companies scrambling to secure suppliers during disruptions. Strategies to Manage Supplier Power Create strategic alliances with unique suppliers to mitigate risk and increase negotiating leverage. Partner with suppliers for mutual growth, e.g., co-developing products or technologies. Identify and invest in the development of alternative suppliers or sources of critical materials. Use analytics to monitor market trends, predict supplier behavior, and strengthen your position. Evaluate opportunities to control parts of your supply chain, where possible. Implications of Supplier Power With digital transformation, and sustainability goals, supplier power is more dynamic than ever: Access to global suppliers reduces reliance on local monopolies. ESG considerations are driving demand for ethically sourced materials, giving power to suppliers with green credentials. AI-driven supply chain platforms empower buyers with greater visibility and forecasting. Supplier power isn’t static—it ebbs and flows with market dynamics, technological advances, and industry trends. Understanding and managing this force is key to securing competitive advantage and ensuring long-term profitability.

Drug industry's relationship to hospitals or the relationship of fragmented crude oil buyer to organized OPEC supplier. Importance of volume to supplier: FMCG industry relationship to supermarkets / department stores Dependency on particular Industry: If the suppliers are serving many industries, they will not hesitate to extract maximum profits from each one thereby retaining bargaining power in their hand. However, if a particular industry accounts for a large portion of a supplier group’s volume or profit, then suppliers will want to protect the industry through reasonable pricing and assist in activities such as R&D and lobbying. Differentiation of inputs: Suppliers that offer products that are differentiated commands higher bargaining power. Data migration in enterprise level software combined with a number of other factors, such as training etc can lead to companies avoiding to switch to more modern software for a long time. Impact of inputs on cost or differentiation: labor is an important input. In some countries and industries labor unions are very powerful Switching costs of firms in the industry: When switching costs are high, industry participants find it hard to play suppliers off against one another. The classic examples for high switching costs are: inkjet printers, game consoles, pod coffee machines, Microsoft office products to PC manufacturers. Presence of substitute inputs: In case the product is standardized, suppliers have low bargaining power, tire industry relationship to automobile Manufacturers. Whereas, if there is no substitute for what the supplier group provides e.g., Pilot unions exercise considerable supplier power over airlines. Threat of forward integration: The supplier group can credibly threaten to integrate forward into the industry. In that case, if industry participants make too much money relative to suppliers, they will induce suppliers to enter the market. Limited Competition: Many airports are quasi-local monopolies with steep barriers of entry In short, Suppliers bargaining power is influenced by concentration, diversification, switching cost or government rules.

WishList Member [MM_Member_Data name=”membershipName”] Home Page Bargaining Power of Suppliers Business / By Gennaro Cuofano / March 25, 2024 The bargaining power of suppliers is one of the fundamental factors in Michael Porter’s Five Forces Framework, which is used to analyze industry competitiveness. It assesses the ability of suppliers to influence prices, terms, and conditions in the supply chain. A strong bargaining position allows suppliers to demand higher prices, better payment terms, or other favorable conditions from their customers. Supplier power is not uniform across all industries or markets and can vary significantly based on several factors, including the concentration of suppliers, the uniqueness of their products or services, the availability of substitute suppliers, and the importance of the supplied goods or services to the buyer’s business . Recognizing these determinants is crucial for businesses to make informed sourcing decisions and remain competitive.

These determinants, though not exhaustive, provide valuable insights into the dynamics of supplier-buyer relationships: Supplier Concentration: The concentration of suppliers in an industry can impact their bargaining power. In markets with only a few dominant suppliers, they can exert greater control over prices and terms, as buyers have limited alternatives. Uniqueness of Inputs: Suppliers offering unique or highly specialized products or services may have stronger bargaining power, as buyers may find it challenging to switch to alternative suppliers without sacrificing quality or functionality. Switching Costs: The costs and efforts required for buyers to switch from one supplier to another affect supplier power. High switching costs make buyers less likely to switch, giving suppliers more leverage. Availability of Substitute Inputs: The availability of substitute inputs or materials can influence supplier power. When suitable substitutes are scarce, suppliers can demand higher prices and better terms. Importance of Supplier’s Input: The significance of a supplier’s input to a buyer’s business can impact supplier power. If a supplier provides a critical component or service, the buyer may have limited options and be more dependent on the supplier. Brand Reputation: Suppliers with strong brand reputations or a history of reliability may have an advantage in negotiations, as buyers may be more inclined to maintain relationships with trusted suppliers. Regulatory Environment: Government regulations, trade restrictions, and quality standards can affect supplier power. Compliance with specific regulations or standards can be costly, creating barriers to entry for potential suppliers. Price Volatility: The degree of price volatility in input materials can influence supplier power. Suppliers of stable or predictable-priced inputs may have more negotiating power. Supplier Alliances: Suppliers may form alliances or collaborations to enhance their bargaining power. Collective action can help them negotiate better terms with their customers. Competitive Dynamics: The level of competition among suppliers in an industry can influence supplier power. In highly competitive supplier markets, buyers may have more options and therefore greater bargaining power. Strategies to Address the Bargain",

Suppliers have the power to influence price, as well as the availability of resources/inputs. Suppliers are most powerful when companies are dependent on them and cannot switch to other suppliers because of higher costs or lack of alternative sources. Questions to ask include: Can suppliers affect the company's bottom line? Who are the major suppliers to the industry? Are the suppliers concentrated? Must buyers depend on a few key suppliers? Are the suppliers highly differentiated? Can buyers find alternative products/suppliers? What are the costs of switching suppliers? Does it cost too much to switch? Are suppliers a threat? Can they forward integrate and produce the buyer's product themselves? Research the Supply Chain Finding a company's actual suppliers is often difficult. Many companies do not want to reveal the information to their competitors. Bloomberg lists suppliers as part of its coverage of company relationships. In addition, searching SEC filings, the 10-K , 10-Q and 8-K reports will often result in information about a company's suppliers and partners. Use Databases to Identify Suppliers Search newspapers and trade journals for mentions of a company's suppliers. Sometimes suppliers are happy to report their relationship or contracts with a major company. Go beyond searching with the keywords - \"suppliers\" or \"supply chain.\" Look for mentions of \"new contracts,\" 'joint ventures,\" \"partnerships,\" or \"distributors.\" Other keywords to use when searching are \"procurement,\" \"purchasing,\" \"inventory management,\" \"outsourcing,\" \"suppliers,\" \"warehousing,\" \"logistics\" and \"operations management.\" Use the following databases: ABI/INFORM Collection This link opens in a new window Business Source Complete This link opens in a new window Use Bloomberg to Research the Supply Chain Bloomberg offers a function for supply chain analysis, SPLC <GO>, that tracks a company's key customers, suppliers and competitors. To find Amazon's suppliers, search by the company ticker and function (e.g., AMZN <Equity> SPLC <GO> ). The relationship list can be viewed in a chart or table. Suppliers can be grouped by country to assess geographic concentration in the supply chain. The supplier list can be filtered by industry subgroup or economic sector.

The bargaining power of suppliers is an integral part of this equation, influencing everything from pricing strategies to competitive positioning. This concept is not just for industry veterans or corporate executives; it's equally valuable for startups, small business owners, and even students of business and economics. By grasping how supplier power works, businesses can better navigate the complexities of their industries and make informed decisions that enhance their competitive edge. Understanding Bargaining Power of Suppliers The bargaining power of suppliers refers to the ability of suppliers to influence the terms and conditions of supply in their favor. This influence can manifest in various ways, such as increasing prices, limiting product availability, or altering quality standards. A strong supplier can significantly impact a company's cost structure and profit margins, making it a critical factor in strategic planning. Keep in mind, the concept of supplier power is one of the five forces in Michael Porter's Five Forces framework, a tool widely used to analyze the competitive environment of an industry. This framework helps businesses understand where power lies in a business situation, which can help them tailor their strategies accordingly. By analyzing the bargaining power of suppliers, companies can anticipate potential challenges and opportunities within their supply chain. For more insights on managing these impacts, consider reading about Comprehensive Global Bulk Business Payment Solutions . Interestingly, the bargaining power of suppliers can fluctuate significantly based on economic conditions. For instance, during periods of inflation and supply chain disruptions, supplier power can become more pronounced, affecting their customers' profitability and production capabilities. To further streamline payment processes and manage international transactions effectively, businesses might consider utilizing Bill Pay services. Key Factors Influencing Supplier Power Several factors determine the bargaining power of suppliers, each playing a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of an industry. One major factor is the number of suppliers relative to the number of buyers. When there are only a few suppliers, they naturally hold more power due to the lack of alternatives for buyers. Conversely, a large pool of suppliers dilutes individual power, giving buyers more leverage. Another significant factor is the uniqueness of the supplier's product or service. Suppliers offering differentiated products that are hard to substitute wield more power, as buyers have limited options. High switching costs also amplify supplier power. If changing suppliers involves substantial costs or operational disruptions, buyers are more likely to stick with their current suppliers, even if the terms are not ideal. Lastly, the potential for forward integration, where suppliers can bypass buyers to sell directly to end-users, can also enhance supplier power, as it poses a direct threat to the buyer's market position. âSwitching costs of buyers are high, and the threat of forward integration is significant, suppliers can exert considerable influence over their buyers,â notes a comprehensive analysis of supplier power dynamics. For businesses dealing with international suppliers, understanding ACH vs Wire Transfers: Key Differences Explained can be crucial in managing payment methods effectively. Impact on Companies and Industries The bargaining power of suppliers can have profound impacts on companies and entire industries. For companies, high supplier power often translates to increased costs of goods sold, which can squeeze profit margins and reduce overall profitability. This situation can be particularly challenging for industries that are highly price-sensitive, where even slight increases in input costs can lead to significant competitive disadvantages. On an industry level, strong supplier power can shape industry dynamics by creating barriers to entry for new firms. High supplier power can deter new entrants due to the difficulty of securing favorable terms, thus limiting competition. Furthermore, it can lead to industry consolidation, as companies may seek mergers or acquisitions to gain greater negotiating leverage with powerful suppliers. This consolidation can result in a few dominant players controlling the market, which may stifle innovation and reduce consumer choice. For those interested in the strategic financial tools that can help navigate these dynamics, exploring Top Financial Management Tools for CFOs in 2024 might provide valuable guidance. Examples of High Supplier Power Industries dominated by a small number of suppliers often experience high supplier power. A notable example is the commercial aerospace industry, where Boeing and Airbus hold significant sway over airlines. These companies not only control a large share of the market but also offer highly specialized products with few substitutes, allowing them to dictate terms to their customers. Another example can be found in the technology sector, where companies like Intel have considerable power over computer manufacturers. Intel's high-performance chips are critical components with few alternatives, giving the company leverage to negotiate favorable terms. High switching costs and the absence of comparable substitutes further strengthen Intel's position, exemplifying how supplier power can dominate an industry. Examples of Low Supplier Power In contrast, industries with a large number of suppliers and easily substitutable products often see low supplier power. The fast-food industry is a prime example, where companies like McDonald's benefit from low supplier power. The abundance of suppliers for ingredients like meat, potatoes, and bread gives fast-food chains the flexibility to switch suppliers easily, keeping costs low and terms favorable. Another example is the apparel industry, particularly in regions with a high concentration of textile manufacturers. With numerous suppliers offering similar products, apparel brands can negotiate better prices and terms, reducing the overall power of individual suppliers. This competitive environment forces suppliers to compete on price and quality, benefiting buyers with more choices and better deals. Strategies to Manage Supplier Power To effectively manage supplier power, companies can employ several strategic approaches. One advantage is building long-term relationships with suppliers. Establishing trust and mutual benefits can lead to more favorable terms and reliable supply chains. For instance, securing long-term contracts can lock in prices and conditions, protecting against future price increases and ensuring supply stability. Another strategy is diversifying the supply base. By sourcing from multiple suppliers, companies reduce dependency on any single supplier, creating a competitive environment that can lead to better pricing and terms. Vertical integration is another option, where companies acquire suppliers to gain more control over their supply chain. This approach can reduce reliance on external suppliers and improve cost efficiency, as seen with Tesla's Gigafactory initiative to produce batteries in-house.

Start Preparing Five Forces Analysis In strategic management, Michael Porter's Five Forces Analysis is a framework used to analyze the competitive environment of an industry. One of the crucial components of this model is the Bargaining Power of Suppliers . This force determines the extent to which suppliers can influence the terms and conditions of business operations. Source: Power Slides Understanding the Concept of Bargaining Power of Suppliers The bargaining power of suppliers refers to the capacity of individual suppliers to increase product prices, reduce product quality, or limit the number of products they sell. For instance, Apple Inc. is notorious for its dependence on Foxconn , a Chinese electronics manufacturer, for a major part of its device production. This scenario potentially amplifies Foxconn's bargaining power, making Apple vulnerable to its supply terms. Factors Influencing the Bargaining Power of Suppliers Source: eCampus Ontario Pressbooks Several factors influence the bargaining power of suppliers: Number and Size of Suppliers A market dominated by a few, large suppliers increases their power. For instance, the commercial aerospace industry is largely dominated by Boeing and Airbus , reducing the bargaining power of airlines. Uniqueness and Value of the Supplier's Product or Service The more unique a product or service, the greater the supplier's power. For example, Intel's high-performance chips are unparalleled in the market, increasing their bargaining power. Cost of Switching Suppliers High switching costs strengthen the power of suppliers. This is evident in industries where heavy machinery is involved, such as manufacturing or construction. Availability of Substitute Goods/Services When suppliers offer products that have few substitutes, their power increases . Dependence on the Industry by the Suppliers If a supplier's business heavily depends on the industry, they're less likely to risk their relationship with the buyer, reducing their power. The Impact of High Supplier Power on Businesses High supplier power can negatively impact businesses in various ways: It may lead to increased production costs due to higher input prices. It can cause supply chain disruptions , as seen in the global semiconductor shortage . High supplier power may limit business growth and expansion due to constrained resources. How to Manage and Mitigate the Bargaining Power of Suppliers In the face of supplier power, businesses must deploy strategic approaches to maintain a balance of power and protect their competitive advantage. Here's how: Developing Supplier Relationships and Contracts Long-term relationships with suppliers can cultivate trust and mutual benefits. By maintaining strong relationships, businesses can negotiate favorable contract terms and ensure reliable supply chains. For example, McDonald's maintains long-term relationships with its suppliers, ensuring consistent product quality across its global outlets. Moreover, businesses can secure long-term contracts to lock in current prices and protect against future price increases. These contracts may also offer favorable conditions, such as volume discounts or first access to new products. Diversifying Supply Base One effective way to mitigate the bargaining power of suppliers is to diversify the supply base. Relying on a single supplier for critical input exposes a business to a significant amount of risk. If that supplier increases prices, the company may be forced to absorb the cost or pass it on to consumers. By diversifying the supply base, a company can reduce its dependency on a single supplier. This is what Apple did when it began sourcing its OLED screens for iPhones from both Samsung and LG, reducing its reliance on a single supplier and creating a competitive environment that can lead to better pricing and terms. Investing in In-house Production or Vertical Integration Vertical integration is another strategy for managing supplier power. It involves the expansion of business operations into stages of production that were previously supplied by businesses up or down the supply chain. Tesla is a classic example of this, as they built their Gigafactory to produce batteries in-house, significantly reducing their dependence on external battery suppliers. Negotiation Tactics and Strategies Strong negotiation skills can also help businesses manage supplier power. Companies can negotiate for lower prices, better payment terms, or improved service levels. Source: VIA Mediation Centre Knowledge of the market, understanding the supplier's costs, and demonstrating the value you bring as a customer are all critical aspects of successful negotiation. For instance, Walmart, known for its strong of the world's largest retailers negotiates favorable terms with its suppliers. negotiation tactics often manage to keep its costs low by leveraging its position as one Leveraging Technology for Supplier Management With the rise of digital technology, businesses can now manage suppliers more effectively. Supply chain management software can provide better visibility into supplier performance, streamline communication, and quickly identify and mitigate risks. Companies can also use data analytics to evaluate supplier performance and make informed decisions. For instance, companies like Unilever use digital solutions to assess the sustainability practices of their suppliers, ensuring they align with their corporate social responsibility goals. Effects of Digitalization and Globalization on the Bargaining Power of Suppliers Digital platforms and e-commerce have made it easier for suppliers to reach consumers directly, potentially increasing their power. On the other hand, globalization has brought more suppliers into the market, often leading to a decrease in supplier power. Thus, businesses need to strategically navigate these shifts to stay competitive.

Start for Free Ivan Kitov • 26 Mar 2024 • 4 min read Suppliers have direct input into a firm’s products or services. For some, this may be labor, marketing, distribution, raw materials, and others. In this context, a company looking to purchase plays the role of a buyer and the supplier – that of a seller. As such, businesses must maintain a healthy buyer-seller relationship. When we say that suppliers are powerful, we refer to their ability to manipulate prices, delivery times, availability, and even the quality of supplied products. Therefore, the profitability of a business that relies on other companies to satisfy operational needs is greatly affected by any supplier maneuvering. This is what we call the bargaining power of suppliers. It is one of Porter’s 5 Forces , along with the threat of new entrants , industry rivalry, bargaining power of buyers , and the threat of substitutes. Types of Suppliers Industries require various types of suppliers to cater to their operational needs in the value chain. Generally, we can divide them into four groups: Manufacturers are suppliers that produce parts, components, machinery, and raw materials, required by another company to assemble their end product. A manufacturer whose products are standard and easy to find elsewhere will exert low bargaining power. Alternatively, those with industry-specific knowledge and little competition do have a strong power over buyers. Distributors & Wholesalers play the role of a middleman. They buy products from a manufacturer in bulk and resell them at a higher price to retailers. Distributors make such products accessible to the end-user in small quantities.  That’s something big manufacturers can rarely provide. Importer suppliers are often referred to as domestic distributors and wholesalers. They simply buy internationally produced and distributed products and sell them at the local market. Independent suppliers are special in that they make a limited number of exquisite products and offer them through representatives. They have the know-how to deliver highly specialized items and will likely have a strong power over buyers. Determining Factors Similar to buyers, the range of supplier power may vary among industries, and over time. Broadly speaking, a supplier power analysis includes the following industry-specific determinants: Concentration of suppliers represents the buyer-supplier ratio. If there are many suppliers and a few buyers, we observe low bargaining power. By contrast, many firms depending on one or two suppliers inevitably boost the bargaining power of those distributors. Sales Percentage determines how big of a customer a firm is to the supplier. If a small percentage of revenue is involved, suppliers will be less willing to negotiate on terms. At the same time, the buyer will have no choice but to agree with it, as they need this delivery. As a result, suppliers’ purchasing power grows. Substitutes refer to other suppliers a company may buy the desired goods from. Having many alternatives to choose from makes the dependency on one particular supplier low, which weakens supplier power as well. If, however, a firm has limited options, its current suppliers may exert strong bargaining power. Materials scarcity has to do with the type and quality of products delivered. If there is only one supplier with the right quality of input needed for a firm’s production line, any shortages or schedule changes will have a significant impact on the end product. Thus, supplier power goes up. The shelf life of a stock makes a difference, too. Any need for short-lived items builds up supplier power, too, as companies can hardly store big quantities of such products in their warehouses in anticipation of supply disruptions. Switching costs shows how expensive it is to change suppliers. High switching costs make most companies stick to their current suppliers, and vice versa – low cost of change provides a high level of flexibility to firms. Forward integration is an important determinant to consider. It describes the threat of a supplier seizing to deliver products to firms and starting to manufacture the end products of its former buyers. In other words, direct competition occurs if a supplier turns retailer. Strong Bargaining Power of Suppliers Strong bargaining power gives supplies the chance to negotiate favorable production, delivery, and payment terms to their advantage. Supplier power is high when: Many buyers concentrate on a few suppliers Suppliers are big enough to have the potential for forward integration The offered products are differentiated The switching costs (of suppliers) are high No substitutes exist Suppliers earn revenues through many small sales, without dominant buyers to depend on Weak Bargaining Power of Suppliers Similarly, the bargaining power of suppliers is low when: There are a few buyers and many suppliers Buyers do not depend on suppliers to produce the goods and services The offered products are not differentiated The switching costs (of suppliers) are low Substitutes are available Suppliers depend on the size of a buyer with respect to their revenues Supplier Bargaining Power: A Practical Look Let’s consider the aviation industry. In the air transport sector, there two main aircraft manufacturers – Airbus and Boeing. When airlines purchase planes, their options are very concentrated. Besides, it is close to impossible to find substitutes for these two suppliers. Switching from Airbus to Boeing does come at a cost, too. So, airlines typically prefer negotiating with either of the two. Because of the high product differentiation, both Airbus and Boeing generally have high bargaining powers. And so does aviation as a whole. A big player in the industry is Southwest Airlines. It is one of the world’s biggest low-cost carriers, with 728 planes in service and nearly 300 more to come. Owing to their efficient parameters in terms of fuel and maintenance, the airline’s fleet consists of Boeing 737 aircraft exclusively. Despite being its major supplier, Boeing exerts a moderate to high bargaining power over Southwest. That’s because the airline is equally important to the supplier – Southwest is the biggest client of Boeing, hitting a substantial sales percentage. The Bottom Line The bargaining power of suppliers is extremely important to a company’s profitability.  However, it does not tell us the whole story. The bargaining power of buyers and the threat of new entrants are other key components involved in the model for you to review. To gain a better understanding of a firm’s competitive position, one should conduct a thorough Porter’s 5 Forces analysis. We recommend you take a practical look at Walmart’s competitive analysis our team has carried out.

Table Of Contents What Is The Bargaining Power Of Suppliers? The bargaining power of suppliers refers to the ability of suppliers to influence the terms and conditions of a business relationship with their buyers. The aim of analyzing the bargaining power of suppliers is for businesses to understand the level of influence suppliers have over their operations and costs. Suppliers with strong bargaining power can demand higher prices for their products or services, potentially increasing the cost of production for the buying company. This, in turn, affects the company's profitability and pricing strategies . In other words, a supplier with significant power might limit the supply or prioritize other customers, causing disruptions in the buyer's operations and smooth functioning. Table of contents What Is the Bargaining Power of Suppliers? Bargaining Power of Suppliers Explained How To Determine? Examples Threats How To Reduce? Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Recommended Articles The bargaining power of suppliers represents the level of control suppliers have over the businesses or customers that purchase goods or services from them. A supplier with high bargaining power can demand higher prices, impose stricter terms, or reduce the availability of products, putting pressure on the buying company. On the other hand, when suppliers have low bargaining power, buyers have more negotiation control and can expect better. It is crucial for businesses as it helps them make informed decisions about supplier management, pricing strategies, and risk assessment in their supply chain. Bargaining Power Of Suppliers Explained The concept of the bargaining power of suppliers is a key element of Porter's Five Forces framework, a strategic tool used to analyze the competitive forces that influence an industry's attractiveness and profitability. The Five Forces in Porter's framework are as follows: Bargaining power of suppliers The threat of new entrants Threat of substitute products or services Bargaining power of buyers Intensity of competitive rivalry The bargaining power of suppliers refers to suppliers' ability to influence the terms and conditions of a business relationship with their buyers. Suppliers with significant bargaining power can exercise their influence in various ways: Price Setting: Suppliers with high bargaining power can demand higher prices for their products or services, potentially impacting a buyer's costs and profit margins . Terms and Conditions: Powerful suppliers may impose strict terms and conditions on their buyers, affecting contractual agreements, payment schedules, or delivery requirements. Availability of Resources: If suppliers control essential or unique resources, they can limit the availability of those resources to buyers, potentially causing disruptions in production or service delivery. Switching Costs: Suppliers can influence buyers by making it costly or challenging for them to switch to alternative suppliers. How To Determine? In order to determine the bargaining power of suppliers, businesses can conduct a comprehensive analysis by considering various factors and conducting thorough research. Here's a step-by-step approach: Identify Key Suppliers: Identify the suppliers that provide critical inputs or services for the business operations . These could include raw materials , components, technology, or specialized services. Research Market Structure: Assess the market structure to understand the number of suppliers operating in the industry. A concentrated market with a few dominant suppliers may indicate higher supplier bargaining power. Supplier Concentration: Determine the market share and dominance of each supplier. Suppliers with a significant market share often have more bargaining power. Uniqueness of Products or Services: Evaluate whether the products or services the suppliers provide are unique, specialized, or readily available from other sources. Unique offerings can give suppliers greater bargaining power. Availability of Substitutes: Identify if there are readily available substitutes for the products or services the suppliers offer. The availability of substitutes may reduce supplier power. Examples Let us look at the bargaining power of supplier examples to understand the concept better - Example #1 Imagine a small coffee shop getting its coffee beans from local suppliers. The owner wants to know how much influence these suppliers have. After checking, there are only two local bean suppliers in the area. Supplier A has 60% of the market, and Supplier B has 40%. Supplier A has special coffee beans that others don't, which helps them stand out. However, a few other regional suppliers with basic beans offer alternatives. It's not too hard for the coffee shop to switch between Suppliers A and B or regional suppliers because of flexible contracts. Supplier A's high-quality beans and reputation bring customers to the coffee shop. So, the coffee beans from Supplier A are important. Supplier B is open to discussing prices and delivery terms to keep the coffee shop as a customer. Looking at everything, the coffee shop owner decides Supplier A has more power because of unique products, reputation, and importance. The owner plans to keep good relations with suppliers and check out other regional options for basic beans to be safe. This way, the coffee shop can handle supplier power well and keep its supply chain steady and affordable. Example #2 Samsung is a big supplier of special OLED screens used in iPhones. They're known for great quality screens that many smartphone makers want. Because of this, Samsung has a lot of power in this situation for a few reasons: Unique Product: Samsung's OLED screens are good, come with bright colors, good contrast, and less power use. This makes them a top choice for fancy phones. Not Many Choices: Only a few companies can make OLED screens as good as Samsung's, so there aren't many other options for Apple. Hard to Change: If Apple wanted to use a different kind of screen, they'd have to change a lot in their phones. This takes time and money, so switching to a different supplier is not easy. Samsung has so much power. Hence, Apple has made deals to get a steady supply of Samsung's OLED screens. Apple is also working on making its own OLED screens to rely less on Samsung. This example shows how a supplier's special products, few alternatives, and important role can affect their power over a big customer like Apple. Threats The threats posed by the bargaining power of suppliers can have significant implications for businesses and industries. Some of the key threats include: Increased Input Costs: Suppliers with high bargaining power can demand higher prices for their products or service",

It is just as important to choose the right supplier as it is to know how to deal with them. The power to negotiate with suppliers is a tool that a company must have. In fact, this skill is one of the 5 forces developed by Porter to understand the agents that affect a company’s profitability. In today’s post we will see what Porter’s 5 forces are and we will focus on the one that interests us: bargaining power with suppliers. Porter’s 5 forces These forces are part of an economic model developed by Michael Porter to determine the competitive variables that a business usually faces in any market. With this model, Michael reminds us that a company’s rivals are not only its direct competitors, but that it must also take into account the series of agents represented by these forces. We already know one of the 5 strengths is the ability to negotiate with suppliers, but what are the other four forces? We will look at them in order: Bargaining power of customers . If there are many suppliers or substitute products, customers have a high bargaining power. If they do not like the price you offer them, they simply go to another company or business that has the same products but at a lower price. This fact creates leverage on companies and they must lower their prices. However, if the consumer can only buy from a single supplier, their bargaining power decreases and the power lies with the supplier. Bargaining power of suppliers. Let’s take an example: farmers refuse to work until there is a fair payment for their crops and therefore stop supplying produce. The price of these (lettuce, tomatoes, etc.) will rise to meet demand and supply will decrease. The bargaining strength lies with the suppliers, as any company in need of their products will not be able to afford such a strike. Threat of new competitors. The fewer the number of competitors, the stronger a business will be. It will also be more powerful if it leads the market. That is why pioneers always have a great competitive advantage over companies that join later to take over the monopoly. Threat of new products. This force contemplates products or services that address the same need. Innovation is the great ally of this force. For a company that sells cars, substitute products would be motorcycles or electric bicycles. Rivalry among competitors. This is the most well-known force of all. The more competition and rivalry there is between companies, the more aggressive the fight to attract customers will be. Differentiation strategies are gradually diminishing, leaving only price reduction as the main competition. Quality takes a back seat. As a company, performing an analysis of all these forces will give you more information about the context of your business. However, the results alone do not represent an answer or a strategy. What is bargaining power with suppliers? Let’s take a closer look at this strength: supplier bargaining power is the ability of suppliers to negotiate the price of the services they offer with the companies to which they supply them. As a general rule, a supplier will offer lower quality or pass on costs to its customers in order to increase its profits. The final company’s or marketer’s product will therefore become more expensive. If the influence of suppliers is high, customers will be at a disadvantage when negotiating costs or terms of trade. This is why it is so important for companies to carry out a good analysis to know their advantages and disadvantages vis-à-vis suppliers. The bargaining power with suppliers can be determined through an analysis and should be taken into account before starting a business . If it already exists, it has to be done before even creating a business plan or marketing strategy. If a supplier offers a product for which there is no possible substitute, it has greater bargaining power. The same is true if it has little competition in the market. However, if the product is easy to substitute or the supplier is dependent on the industry to which it sells, its influence decreases. The bargaining power of suppliers affects business profitability , as do Porter’s other forces. But how are they related? The bargaining power of customers puts pressure on companies to reduce the final price of their products or services because consumers will, in most things, seek to pay less. If suppliers have the strength to raise the costs of a resource (which will make the product more expensive) and end customers have the influence to demand a lower price, the company will have less profit and could become unprofitable. The relationship exists not only between these 2 forces, but also between the 5 discussed by Porter . Hence its importance for the creation and management of a company. The results generated by the study can be used in the SWOT analysis of the company to catalog them. What factors determine the bargaining power of suppliers? There are 6 factors that determine the power that suppliers can have in a negotiation with a company: Few suppliers. If the sector is dominated by few companies or firms providing a product, the bargaining power lies almost entirely with the suppliers. Fragmented buyers. If there are many competitors in a market offering the same product and many buyers to purchase it, bargaining power decreases. Suppliers do not have the ability to vary price and will have to focus on quality. Lack of substitute products. Occurs when there is no substitute product that a company offers in an industry. If demand is high, the influence of suppliers increases. Importance of the industry. If a supplier sells to different industries, the one of lesser importance will have less possibilities to negotiate and will depend on the supplier. Key product for the industry. If a supplier’s product is critical to a market, companies will only be able to adapt to the conditions and prices of their suppliers. Differentiated products. It is possible to compete with rivals that offer the same thing if the products do not compete against those of other suppliers for a feature that differentiates them. How to negotiate with suppliers Here are some tips on how to manage your negotiations with suppliers in the best possible way: Build a relationship. A professional yet friendly relationship is one of the best strategies for negotiating with a supplier. The best strategy is to create bonds through respect, communication and attention to shared needs. This way it will not be very complicated to reach agreements. Search for more suppliers. Research the different suppliers to find out prices, product quality and service. This will allow you to choose the most suitable supplier for you and, in addition, you will have better arguments to negotiate with (you already know the market). By conveying that you know what you are doing thanks to the knowledge you have acquired, you will prevent them from trying to take advantage of you. If you want to break the ice in the best way, we recommend that you praise the qualities of the supplier you want to work with. This tactic usually eliminates tension in a friendly way. Research their customers. By this we mean that you investigate who are and were the clients of this supplier to check if there could be any conflict of interest with the current ones. It is also interesting that you contact past clients to find out how they were treated and the level of satisfaction they received in order to decide whether or not to work with them. Calculate the real price. It i",

What is it? Power of Suppliers Suppliers have the power to influence the price as well as the availability of resources/inputs.  Suppliers are most powerful when companies are dependent on them and cannot switch suppliers because of high costs or lack of alternative sources. Questions to Ask Can suppliers affect the company's bottom line? Who are the major suppliers to the industry? Are the suppliers concentrated? Must buyers depend on a few key suppliers? Are the suppliers highly differentiated? Can buyers find alternative products/suppliers? What are costs of switching suppliers? Does it cost too much to switch? Are suppliers a threat? Can they forward integrate and produce the buyer's product themselves? How to Research the Supply Chain Finding a company's actual suppliers is often very difficult.  Many companies do not want to reveal this information to their competitors. Two databases have scoured the news for you. Both Bloomberg and Mergent Horizon list suppliers as part of their coverage of company relationships. In addition, searching SEC filings, the 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, will often result in information about a company's suppliers and partners. You can also search newspapers and trade journals for mentions of a company's suppliers. Use News Databases to Identify Suppliers You can search newspapers and trade journals for mentions of a company's suppliers. Sometimes suppliers are happy to report their relationship or contracts with a major company. Go beyond just searching with the keywords - suppliers or supply chain. Look for mentions of  new contracts, joint ventures, partnerships, or distributors. Other keywords you might use in your search are procurement, purchasing, inventory management, outsourcing, suppliers, warehousing, logistics and operations management. Use these databases: Business Source Complete ABI/INFORM Global Factiva Use Mergent Online to Identify Suppliers Mergent Onlne offers public company profiles that highlight the relationships between a company's major customers, suppliers, competitors and partners. All supplier connections are identified from SEC filings. Suppliers can be named by the company or can be named as customers by other companies. The Supplier list can be sorted or ranked by revenues or market cap. The list can be filtered by product category or geographic location. Use Bloomberg to Research the Supply Chain Bloomberg offers a function for supply chain analysis, SPLC <GO> , that tracks a company's key customers, suppliers and competitors. For example, to find Amazon's suppliers, search by the company ticker and function. You would type: AMZN <Equity> SPLC <Go> You can view the relationship list in a chart or in a table. Suppliers can be grouped by country to assess geographic concentration in the supply chain. The supplier list can be filtered by industry subgroup or economic sectors. Find Supplier News by typing: NI SUPPLY <Go> or  NI SPLC <Go>.

This sometimes requires an ability to assess and communicate market dynamics in a clear and meaningful way. One classic tool that I use to frame market dynamics is Porter’s Five Forces . If you’ve worked in procurement as long as I have, you’ve most likely come across it many times and might even question if it is still relevant. (Hint: it most certainly is!) Let’s go through practical tips on how to align Porter’s Five Forces to some of the common challenges faced by procurement teams. After we’ve covered some essential definitions we’ll go through how the framework can be applied to strategic sourcing , category management and supplier relationship management. Recap on Porter’s 5 Forces Porter’s Five Forces is a framework for analyzing the competitive landscape of an industry by examining the threat of new entrants, bargaining power of suppliers and buyers, threat of substitutes, and rivalry among existing competitors. First introduced in 1979 by Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter in his Harvard Business Review article “ How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy ,” this framework provides a structured approach to analyzing the competitive forces at play within any industry. Porter’s Five Forces has been taught in universities for decades and is one of the most recognized strategic management frameworks. Here is how you can see these from the perspective of a modern procurement organization. Threat of new entrants This force examines how easily new competitors can enter the market you operate within. A market with high barriers to entry (e.g., high capital investment, strict regulations, strong brand loyalty) is less susceptible to new competitors, potentially giving existing suppliers more power. Conversely, a market with low barriers to entry increases competition, often leading to better prices and more favorable terms for procurement. Bargaining power of suppliers This force examines the influence suppliers have on price and availability. Suppliers hold significant power when there are few alternatives, offer unique products or services, or when switching suppliers is costly. Strong supplier power can impact a buyer’s profitability and flexibility. Bargaining power of buyers This force analyzes the influence you as a buyer have on price and terms. Buyers gain leverage when they purchase large volumes, have multiple sourcing options, or when they account for a large portion of the sales of a supplier. Strong buyer power is usually favorable for procurement. It can help secure favorable pricing and preferential contract terms. Threat of substitute products or services This force considers how easily customers can switch to alternative products or services that fulfill the same need. The threat is high when substitutes are readily available, offer significant price advantages, or when switching costs are low. If the threat of substitutes is high it may be difficult to justify higher prices. Rivalry among existing competitors This central force analyzes the overall intensity of competition within an industry. High rivalry, driven by factors like numerous competitors, slow market growth, or high exit barriers, can result in price competition and the commoditization of different solutions. Porter’s Five Forces in Strategic Sourcing Porter’s Five Forces can give a balanced understanding of market dynamics to help you describe and drive value beyond simple cost reduction. For this reason, it can be applied to different tasks and steps of your strategic sourcing processes . Define your category profile You can use the Five Forces framework to describe competitive market trends in your category profile . When you’re doing this you don’t need to go into great detail. Simply describe the current snapshot “as-is” state of the competitive landscape and what factors procurement organizations need to keep in mind on a high level. Anticipate market disruptions Too often procurement is seen as a function that looks in the rearview mirror. You can use Porter’s Five Forces to build a view of future needs and market trends. Here you can explore emerging technologies, business models, and alternative solutions that could disrupt existing supply chains. This awareness allows you to be ahead of innovations and mitigate the risk of being locked into outdated agreements. Describe supplier dynamics As a procurement leader you sometimes need to be able to step into the shoes of your suppliers. Porter’s Five Forces can be a way to describe the relative position and motivations of key suppliers. In scenarios where supplier power is high, characterized by limited supplier options or unique offerings, procurement should prioritize building strategic partnerships. Conversely, when buyer power is dominant, procurement can leverage its position to negotiate favorable pricing, payment terms, and contractual agreements. If you want to go further in assessing the needs of your suppliers you can consider building an additional supplier preferencing matrix . Build the case for change in strategy Porter’s Five Forces can also help build the case for a shift in sourcing strategy. It gives executives and key stakeholders a clear and easy-to-understand framework to reflect on changing market dynamics. For example, you can use it to show changes in supplier power, the emergence of disruptive new entrants or substitutes, or the impact of intensifying competitive rivalry on pricing. Uses for Five Forces in Category Management You don’t need to limit the use of this framework to strategic sourcing projects. Porter’s Five Forces can also be a framework to inspire aspects of your broader category strategy . (Re-)assess your category taxonomy You can analyze the differences in supplier power, threat of new entrants, and competitive rivalry within specific categories or sub-categories to get a broader perspective on where to focus your time. This could help prioritize resources towards categories with more favorable market dynamics where you can secure better value. Informed supplier relationships You can have open and transparent discussion",

Our free online course Introduction to Market Sizing offers a practical 30-minute primer on market research and calculating market size. The presence of powerful suppliers reduces the profit potential in an industry. Suppliers increase competition by threatening to raise prices or reduce the quality of goods and services. As a result, they reduce profitability in industries where companies cannot recover cost increases in their own prices. The bargaining power of suppliers is one of the five forces that determine the intensity of competition in an industry. The others are barriers to entry, industry rivalry, the threat of substitutes and the bargaining power of buyers. Power of supplier group The following conditions indicate that a supplier group is powerful: It is dominated by a small number of companies and is more concentrated than the industry to which it sells It is not required to contend with substitute products for sale in the industry The industry is not one of the supplier’s important customers Its products are an important part of the buyer’s business Its products are differentiated or there are built-up switching costs It poses a clear threat of forward integration How to mitigate a strong bargaining power of supplier Centralize procurement If you have multiple business units that independently procure raw materials from the same vendor, establish a central procurement unit that consolidates all orders while negotiating prices for your business units and dictating your terms; failure to follow these terms will result in the cancellation of all purchases. Diversify your supply chain By diversifying your supply chain, you can reduce your reliance on a single supplier. This will also enable you to develop long-term competitive advantage and resilience to supply chain disruptions in such situations as war and pandemics. Use substitutes If you are a manufacturer, look for a raw material substitute that has the same function and quality required by your products. If a substitute is available, use this instead of your original raw materials. As a result, the possibility of your single supplier becoming more dominant is significantly reduced. Backward integration Examine your company’s ability to integrate backward. If you start producing key supplies for your business/manufacturing, you can eliminate your supplier’s bargaining power. For example, Apple has begun developing its own processors to reduce its reliance on powerful vendors, such as AMD and Intel. This can also help you gain control of your supply chain, enhance product quality and save total costs. Competing with your supplier This is similar to backward integration, except that you do not cut ties with your supplier. Such companies as Walmart, Costco and other retail players have their private label products that compete with the brands of their suppliers. This maintains control over price hikes and supply chain manipulation by suppliers. This scenario is more relevant in the retail industry, where multiple brands are sold under one roof. Keep in mind that you will need to work on your branding and marketing, since customers will come to you to buy your private label products because of your brand value. Bring new value to your supplier If you have plans to expand into a new geography or industry where suppliers have tried but failed to penetrate, you can offer them a new market opportunity in exchange for price concessions. If the offer is lucrative enough, you can gain the upper hand in price negotiation. Strategic partnership agreement If you are a bulk buyer, you can control your suppliers’ bargaining power by negotiating and signing an exclusivity agreement with them. This agreement lowers the risk of them selling the product directly to customers in your area and competing with you. You can also make sure that your supplier is not selling any raw materials to your competitor to reduce your margins. Keep in mind that your supplier may require you to make certain commitments in exchange for signing such an exclusivity agreement. A careful examination of the cost and value of your supply chain is required to assess your suppliers’ bargaining power in your business, which can be identified and mitigated by considering one or more of the following options: Changing how you buy Assessing what value you can offer to your supplier Building a robust supply chain Becoming self-sufficient Conducting strategic negotiations Hitesh Badgujar New guide: Bridging markets in the Indo-Pacific: How startups and MNCs accelerate growth Discover how collaborating with industry giants can catapult your startup overseas.

The term Porter analysis refers to company business plans and their attempt to gauge the forces that affect a company’s chances for success. The five forces include threats from new products and services, competition from established rivals, threats of new companies entering the market, bargaining power of buyers and bargaining power of suppliers. Restaurants must deal with these forces in business planning or face limited business success or eventual failure. Bargaining Power of Suppliers Threatens Restaurant Success Monopolistic suppliers buy out their competitors in suburban and rural areas to increase their control of prices . Government agencies and legal actions can break monopolies and prosecute secretive collusion agreements, but these arrangements are not only difficult to detect but also hard to prove in court. Bargaining power refers to the ability to set higher prices for goods and services, and restaurants face bargaining situations when buying food, paper goods, maintenance services, restaurant equipment and furnishings, and sanitary supplies. Ideally, free market forces set prices, but suppliers charge lower prices for their best customers and raise prices for smaller companies, adding additional expenses . Big chain stores virtually set their own prices for the goods that they buy. Walmart, the biggest company in the world, has the power to drop suppliers and brands that don’t offer competitive wholesale prices. Ruth’s Hospitality Group , one of the top upscale restaurant chains, has tremendous buying power because it can draw from multiple suppliers from throughout the country. Panera Bread reduces its suppliers’ bargaining powers by making foods from scratch, baking its own bread from basic ingredients and buying raw ingredients from a nationwide pool of suppliers. Chipotle has enjoyed phenomenal success by embracing organic and sustainable local produce and charging a premium for menu items that customers are willing to pay. Subway bakes its own bread and has multiple restaurants in most areas, so the company has tremendous bargaining power with its suppliers. Smaller restaurants don’t have these advantages in negotiations or pricing their menus. Fast food operations are particularly vulnerable to suppliers because profit margins in these restaurants leave little room for price increases without passing on the costs to customers. In the competitive food industry, people just dine at other restaurants if prices are too high at their regular fast food place. Smaller restaurants face an even bigger threat from a landlord if the restauranteurs do not own the location. Landlords try to increase the rent at the end of a lease and can change the future prospects of a business overnight from black to red. If you can, seek out longer leases and prepare for rent hikes. Strategies to Counter Restaurant Suppliers’ Bargaining Powers Restaurants need to consider suppliers and alternatives before they open their doors to protect them from unreasonable price increases and ensure uninterrupted supplies. Food is the most critical supply to protect because fewer companies offer deliveries of full lines of restaurant supplies in smaller markets. Restaurants can find plenty of alternatives for services, furniture, paper goods, equipment and restaurant chemicals. Strategies to reclaim bargaining power from suppliers include the following techniques: Develop alternative suppliers for essential ingredients and supplies by prequalifying for accounts and emergency deliveries. Diversify menus to include multiple suppliers. Promote sustainability by working with local produce vendors, farms, dairies and butchers. Consider buying supplies from big box stores, food warehouses and grocery chains. Join organic and health food cooperatives or coalitions to increase bargaining power. Choose suppliers that offer dedicated sales representatives who negotiate prices, solve delivery problems and recommend cost savings and new products. Monitor prices regularly to spot unusual price increases, and mention any changes that seem unfair or inaccurate. Keep a tight inventory to take advantage of seasonal prices, reduce restaurant waste and minimize employee theft and misadventure. Restaurant can consolidate suppliers by agreeing to a prime-vendor arrangement in return for a supplier’s best prices on supplies. Make sure that alternatives are available in emergencies or if the supplier doesn’t fulfill its promises. Small restaurants and food operations might not have the bargaining power of the big chains, but they can lower their vulnerability to monopolistic suppliers by developing alternative supply strategies.

Recommended Course Home / Free Resources / Credit / Porter’s Five Forces Porter’s Five Forces By Carl Agbor Beecham | March 18, 2022 What are “Porter’s Five Forces”? Porter’s Five Forces is a business strategy framework that identifies and explains the key factors that influence competition in an industry. According to the model, the competitive landscape of an industry is shaped by five fundamental forces. These five forces, first identified by Michael E. Porter in an academic article published in 1979, play a vital role in shaping and explaining the long-term profit potential of an industry. According to Michael E. Porter, the five forces which highlight an industry’s profit potential, competitive framework, and overall attractiveness are: Competitive Rivalry Threat of Entry Supplier Bargaining Power Buyer Bargaining Power Threat of Substitutes Porter’s model is important because a solid understanding of the competitive landscape is essential when formulating a corporate strategy. Key Learning Points Porter’s Five Forces provides a framework for analyzing the competitive environment of a particular industry The availability of substitute products, strength and number of competitive rivals, the ease with which new entrants can enter the industry, and the power of consumers and suppliers have a direct impact on a company’s profitability A deep understanding of Porter’s Five Forces equips business strategists with the necessary tools and information to increase their company’s competitive advantage in a particular industry Understanding Porter’s Five Forces Porter’s Five Forces is one of the most highly regarded business strategy tools. The model is used to analyze an industry’s attractiveness and potential profitability. A corporate strategist’s goal when employing this business model is to gain a competitive advantage for their company over others. A deep understanding of the sources of competitive pressure highlights the critical strengths and weaknesses of the company and determines its position in the industry. It also identifies the areas where strategic changes may yield the greatest payoff and highlights the areas where industry trends promise to hold the greatest significance as either opportunities or threats. 1.     Competitive Rivalry Competitive rivalry examines the number and strength of a company’s existing competitors. Rivalry can take on several forms, including price discounting, new product introductions, advertising campaigns, and service improvements. Porter suggested that rivalry can be incredibly destructive to profitability if it leans heavily towards price alone. In an industry where rivalry is intense, companies attract customers by aggressively cutting prices and launching high-impact marketing campaigns. Suppliers and buyers will seek out a company’s competition if they can offer a better deal or lower prices. On the other hand, when competitive rivalry is low, a company has greater power and freedom to charge higher prices and set the terms of deals to achieve higher sales and profits. This gives the company tremendous competitor power as well as healthy profits. The competitive rivalry in an industry becomes more intense based on the number of competitors, industry growth, and the barriers to entry and exit. 2.     Threat of Entry The introduction of new entrants into its market or industry significantly impacts an existing company’s power. New entrants to an industry bring new capacity, the desire to gain market share, and often substantial resources. The threat posed by new entrants depends on the barriers present and the reaction from existing competitors that entrants can expect. These barriers to entry can be in the form of economies of scale, product differentiation, capital requirements, cost disadvantages, access to distribution channels, and government policy. Where such barriers are high, the threat of entry is low. If barriers to entry are high and newcomers can expect sharp retaliation from the existing competitors, then new entrants do not present any significant threat. Alternatively, the less time and money it costs a competitor to enter a company’s market and become an effective competitor, the more likely it is that the existing company’s position will become weakened. In other words, the fewer the barriers to entry, the greater the threat posed by new entrants. Additionally, if new entrants do not face any pushback from existing companies, such as price cuts to maintain market share and industry growth is on the rise, the threat of entry is significantly amplified. 3.     Supplier Bargaining Power Supplier bargaining power is determined by how easy it is for a company’s suppliers to increase the cost of inputs or reduce the quality of purchased goods and services. Powerful suppliers can squeeze profitability out of an industry. This is affected by the number of suppliers of critical inputs of a good or service, the uniqueness of these inputs and the switching costs involved. The bargaining power of suppliers is intensified where the supplier group is dominated by a few companies and is more concentrated than the industry it sells to, the product is unique or at least differentiated, and there are high switching costs in addition, where there is a threat of forward vertical integration and if the industry is not an important customer of the supplier group. All these factors significantly increase supplier bargai",
