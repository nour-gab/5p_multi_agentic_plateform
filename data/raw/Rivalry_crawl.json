Halfway through 2024 and looking beyond, it’s clear that this industry will continue to transform and shape the way people interact with money. From paying bills to investing, taking loans, and buying goods, modern financial solutions are forecasted to continuously improve and disrupt the market. In this article, we’ll explore the key fintech trends that could have the most significant impact on this niche in the years to come. The list of potential tendencies is based on years of experience in creating fintech software, various reports delivered by specialists in the field, and our clients’ ambitions to deliver valuable, high-quality services to consumers interested in future-proof financial products, systems, and apps. Table of contents Fintech Industry Overview Before we dive into the thrilling world of the possibilities that the global fintech market can embrace, let’s have a look at what and who shaped the current landscape. Additionally, we want to discuss the potential of the ongoing situation and which areas will probably expand in the future. Brief History of Fintech The roots of the fintech industry can be traced back to the mid-20th century, when in 1950 the first credit card was invented. In 1967, the first ATM was introduced. Both these events marked the beginning of technology’s integration into financial services. However, the term “fintech” itself gained prominence with the advent of internet banking in the 1990s. This period saw the first wave of fintech innovation, with banks moving their services online and creating the foundation for online banking as we know it today. The second wave of fintech came in the early 2000s and was characterized by the rise of mobile banking and alternative lending market (e.g. peer-to-peer). Companies like PayPal emerged during this time, revolutionizing online payments and setting the stage for future inventions in that area. The 2008 financial crisis proved to be a catalyst for the third wave of fintech. Its aftermath caused mistrust in traditional financial organizations, creating an opportunity for startups to fill the gaps within the banking industry. Bitcoin and blockchain were introduced a year later, causing another boom in the financial market and raising many questions about the future of money. The popularity of smartphones and mobile devices skyrocketed, and the 2020 pandemic caused another market shift caused by a burning need for contactless, mobile-only solutions. Over the years, fintech industry has experienced rapid growth and diversification. Right now, the biggest technological novelty that changes it is artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics that became faster, more accurate, and less prone to errors thanks to advanced algorithms. Fintech offers a wide range of services adjusted to various clients’ requirements, including insurtech and regtech solutions. Current Market State Today, the fintech market is characterized by a blend of startups and established financial institutions, all leveraging technology to offer more accessible, efficient, and personalised financial services. Tech innovations are driving the industry forward, so it’s not surprising that the fintech investments and spending are reaching new heights each year. According to the report by Allied Market Research : “The global fintech market was valued at $110.57 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $698.48 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 20.3% from 2021 to 2030.” That indicates an extremely rapid growth in the upcoming years. Increased competition is another factor that strongly shapes the fintech space. Traditional financial organizations have to face startups and tech giants entering the financial sector, while the number of fintech brands increases. Currently, there are approximately 30 000 startups that operate within this market worldwide. This number almost tripled since 2019. As the market matures, there’s an increasing fintech trend of mergers and acquisitions, with larger fintech companies acquiring smaller ones to expand their service offerings. Additionally, many financial brands are looking beyond their home markets, expanding internationally to capture new opportunities. With the growing influence of fintech, regulators are paying closer attention to the sector, leading to the development of new regulatory frameworks. Moreover, there’s a growing fintech trend of collaboration between fintech startups and traditional financial brands, combining innovative approaches with regulatory expertise. Such partnerships also allow involved sides to enhance their capabilities and stay competitive. The market is also seeing a fintech trend towards consolidation, with larger fintech businesses acquiring smaller startups to expand their service offerings and market reach. The fintech sector is playing a crucial role in bringing payment providers and other services to underserved populations, particularly in developing countries. The landscape is becoming increasingly global, with significant growth in regions such as Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Africa. These emerging markets are seeing rapid adoption of fintech solutions, often winning with established banking infrastructures. Furthermore, there’s an increasing focus on sustainable and ethical finance, with many fintechs developing products and services that align with ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) principles. What Influences the Fintech Industry? There are several factors that drive the growth of the fintech niche: Increased smartphone usage and internet connectivity, particularly in growing markets, is expanding the potential user base for fintech services. Changing consumer expectations, especially among Millennials and Gen Z, who demand digital-first, personalized financial solutions. Advancements in technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and cloud computing, which are enabling more sophisticated and efficient financial capabilities. Regulatory changes, such as open banking initiatives, which are fostering innovation and competition in the financial sector. The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has accelerated the shift towards digital financial services. Major Players in the Industry Several companies have emerged as leaders in the fintech space, revolutionising various aspects of financial services. These brands, among others, are at the forefront of innovation, setting fintech trends and shaping the future of this growing industry: Shopify: A Canadian e-commerce platform that has expanded into fintech landscape, offering payment processing and small business loans.

forecast period (2024-2029). In the financial industry, fintech stands for financial technology. In businesses that offer automated and enhanced financial services, fintech refers to computer programs and other contemporary technologies. The fintech sector has developed significantly over time, which has caused businesses to become more customer-focused. It is, therefore, difficult to find a position among the many businesses that exist worldwide, which range from startups to tech enterprises to well-established businesses. Fintech and financial service organizations have pursued disruptive and new ideas in an ever-changing business landscape, taking up each other's lanes with either a collaborative or a competing attitude. Multiple crises have served as a driving force behind the growth of the fintech industry. Fintech investments have been rising since the last global financial crisis. The traditional financial services sector was severely pressed both during and after the crisis, and its weaknesses led to a technological reaction that resulted in the sector's expansion. In a similar vein, the COVID-19 pandemic also had a disastrous effect on the world economy and started the recession. The fintech industry developed more quickly as a result of this crisis. Large financial institutions collaborated with up-and-coming tech firms in response to the pandemic in order to gain access to the new market. The fintech business is growing even though the companies themselves are looking to collaborate with big banks to broaden their clientele and offerings. In recent years, numerous fintech subtypes, such as insurtech, regtech, payment services, and others, have emerged that employ cutting-edge technologies customized for certain industries or roles. The degree of execution attained in an organization's plan is becoming more significant now that the fintech sector is more than just a fad. The fintech busines",

In June 2024, Dutch neobank Bunq signed significant deals with Mastercard and Nvidia, with the aim of enhancing user experience, broaden open banking interfaces, and enhance AI-driven fraud detection. In addition to these benefits, automation also helps in reducing the operational costs, which further helps these banks to provide loan approvals in seconds, instantaneous deposit and withdrawal services, and accounts with zero fees. Automation also boosts user engagement via chat-based interfaces and smart spending tools.

Availability features such as digital convenience is one of the major factors driving the demand of neo and challenger banks. Unlike traditional banks which require customers to visit their physical branches for basic services, neo banks are accessible through mobile applications anytime and anywhere. The ability for users to open accounts, make payments, transfer money, and manage their funds on the go is attracting younger consumers who are tech savvy and value speed-and accessibility. These facilities reduce the need for standing and waiting in long queues and business hours are no longer needed, making neo banks incredibly convenient and attractive. Neo and Challenger Bank Market Trends Neo and challenger banks are increasingly focusing on mobile applications as their primary means of interaction with customers. Features including immediate alerts, biometric login, and in-app financial planning are thus becoming the baseline expectations for users. AI technology is being implemented more often to offer personalized financial advice, provide insights into spending, and automate savings. This is helping banks to compete on the basis of innovative services in addition to low-cost offerings. Bunq, the second largest neobank in Europe, launched its own generative AI (GenAI) platform named Finn in December 2023, thus making the bank the first AI-powered bank in Europe. Finn is fully integrated into the Bunq app and replaces the traditional search function, offering a chat interface akin to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Due to increasing challenges of cybercrime, neobanks are further strengthening their investments in RegTech, fraud detection, and data protection to ensure trust and comply globally. Neo banks are increasingly offering banking-as-a-service (BaaS) to other platforms, allowing non-bank businesses to integrate financial services such as accounts, cards, and loans into their apps or ecosystems. Neo and Challenger Bank Market Analysis Based on business model, the neo and challenger bank market is segmented into digital-only banks and hybrid banks. In 2024, the digital-only segment was valued at around USD 45 billion and held a market share of over 70%. The absence of large branches or an extensive in-person workforce at digital-only banks helps them minimize their operational costs. Because of this, these banks compete using low-fee or zero-fee services. This makes it cheaper and easier for them to acquire and retain customers compared to traditional or hybrid banks. Digital-only banks offer automated and real-time mobile applications that send alerts, provide budgeting tools, and offer spending insights. This increases the interaction and satisfaction of the customers which results in increased daily usage. Compared to legacy banks, their technology-driven interfaces provide better engagement. Goldman Sachs reported in May 2025 that they are in very early stage talks with the Irish authorities about launching Marcus, their online retail banking platform, in Ireland. If realized, this could drastically alter Ireland's concentrated banking market. Digital-only banks can utilize cloud infrastructure, open banking APIs, and collaborations to scale effortlessly. They can serve millions without significantly increasing expenses, which makes the business model extremely profitable and appealing to investors, accelerating growth. Based on the end use, the neo and challenger bank market is segmented as individual and business. The individual segment dominated in 2024 with a market share of around 63.5%. Clients are now more inclined toward mobile and fast banking services. Challenger and neobanks provide user-friendly mobile applications, allow instant transfers, and offer real-time updates on account activities. Such convenience is perfect for today’s digitally connected consumers. Because of this, consumers have become primary adopters. Digital banks have provided millions of underbanked individuals with financial services. With just a smartphone and basic documentation, individuals can open accounts, obtain credit, and manage funds. This increase in financial access greatly expands the potential customer base, particularly in emerging markets. Most younger individuals are extremely sensitive to costs of banking services. Neo and challenger banks offer services without fee or at very low fee such as no minimum balances, free ATM withdrawals, and inexpensive international transfers. These pricing structures are far more attractive for personal users and shift away from traditional banking fees. Based on services offered, the neo and challenger bank market is segmented as payments and money transfers, savings accounts, loans, investments and wealth management, insurance products, currency exchange, and others. The savings account segment led the market in 2024. Offering savings accounts is usually the first step taken to onboard new customers. It helps form the basis of the customer’s relationship with the bank, thus attracting and retaining clients. For digital banks, easy no-fee savings accounts are beneficial in rapidly expanding their user base. Due to lower operational overhead, neo and challenger banks can provide higher interest rates compared to traditional banks. In addition to digital features such as real-time balance tracking, auto-savings, and even round-up savings, the products offered by these banks are more attractive to the younger individuals. Based on licensing model, the neo and challenger bank market is segmented as fully licensed banks and partnership. The fully licensed banks segment led the market in 2024. Fully licensed banks can manage deposits, lending activities, and compliance directly without the need for partner or third-party banks. This independence helps them widen the scope of services offered at better margins. This independence also enhances the flexibility to innovate and tailor offerings to the customer base. With a full banking license, a bank is trusted to have gone through all regulatory requirements and i",

The dynamics of this era are now shifting for various reasons, including the interest rate environment, regulatory change, and product transformation. Banks have evolved through this period as well, defying predictions of obsolescence by building and acquiring new capabilities. Given recent industry developments, Oliver Wyman examined this decade of change through the lens of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) between banks and fintechs, combining transaction analysis with expert insight from startup founders, bank corporate development executives, and fintech investment bankers. The result is a deal-driven look at bank acquisitions of fintech over the trailing 10 years. For the sake of consistency, our paper defines acquisitions as 100% control of the acquired company and defines fintechs as companies offering or enabling financial services products with a value proposition centered around non-traditional banking capabilities (for example, product, technology, processes, and culture). With these parameters in place, the findings and number of deals may challenge conventional wisdom around bank-fintech M&A. We hope that this paper illustrates the key considerations for both banks and fintechs as they evolve through a shifting landscape. Thank you for reading, Jason Zaler, Guillaume Lamey, Cathy Gao, and the Oliver Wyman team Jason Zaler Partner, Oliver Wyman Guillaume Lamey Partner, Oliver Wyman Cathy Gao Principal, Oliver Wyman Exploring the world of bank-fintech M&A In 1994, Bill Gates famously said: “Banks are dinosaurs. We can bypass them.” Amid the excitement of the first dot.com era and through the global financial crisis and rise of smartphones, thousands of fintechs emerged trying to deliver on Gates’ boast. Fintech funding dramatically increased from $4 billion in 2012 to a peak of $250 billion in 2021 before dipping to $50 billion in the first half of 2023 as interest rates rose sharply and funding dried up. By late 2023, 335 fintech unicorns valued at $1 billion or more had been created across categories ranging from core banking to payments to infrastructure. Some fintechs have reached escape velocity, including PayPal, Square, Stripe, Nubank and Credit Karma. Prominent acquisitions of emerging fintechs included PayPal’s acquisition of Honey for $4 billion, SoFi’s acquisition of Galileo for $1.2 billion, and Block’s (Square) acquisition of Afterpay for $28 billion. While many fintechs have been hugely successful, the net effect on banks is not what Gates predicted. Banks have proven to be extremely resilient: they have retained and expanded their business. While fintechs enjoy many advantages (in innovation, product and technology talent, higher customer satisfaction, flexibility in their tech stack, and analytics) banks also enjoy important advantages (in cost-of-funds, distribution and operational scale, customer acquisition cost, and risk management). Fintechs have not swept banks away — quite the opposite. Instead, opportunities for meaningful partnerships and value creation between banks and fintechs have grown. Viewing their complementary business advantages, many industry observers felt that banks would become active fintech acquirers. However, our analysis shows that this has not been the case: Fewer-than-expected bank-fintech acquisitions: despite their share of the total economy, banks made less than 1% of all fintech acquisitions from 2013 through 2023. In the cohort of top 50 US and top 15 Canadian and International Banks analyzed (collectively known as \"Top Banks\"), only 94 fintech acquisitions were completed in the past 10 years ( Exhibit 1 ). Bank-fintech deals are small: Only 13% of the 94 transactions were over $300 million in size — a figure cited by experts as a dividing line between major and minor fintech deals — with most deals focused on tuck-in capabilities easier to integrate into the bank and less challenging to sunset if derailed by common integration and operating challenges. Long-term fintech acquisition success is tough: the values, incentives, and cultures are often too dissimilar between banks and fintechs. Examples range from regulatory approach to operating model, and can result in product shutdowns, talent attrition, and dilution of asset value. We suspect that this disincentivizes additional acquisitions despite the case for synergies. All acquisitions are risky, but we believe the current moment of decreasing fintech valuations, economic uncertainty, and the search for new capabilities and revenue streams provides an opportunity for banks to explore strategic fintech M&A. Our report, “A Comprehensive Analysis Of Bank-Fintech M&A, How Bank-Fintech Synergy Can Drive M&A Success”, explores the situation on the ground and outlines enablers, barriers, and considerations for successful bank-fintech acquisitions. Exhibit 1: Top banks¹ make up less than 1% of all fintech acquirers All global transactions, 2013–2023 1: Top 50 US and top 15 international banks (excluding China) Source: Refinitiv, Pitchbook, FT Partners and Oliver Wyman analysis Chapter 1 Successes and challenges in the fintech M&A landscape It stands to reason that banks should buy fintechs for technology innovation, client and revenue growth, new product capabilities, customer base expansion, and to defend their own perimeter. However, this has occurred less frequently than expected over the past decade, often because fintech valuations were too high for banks to justify, concerns over cultural fit, and overall economic uncertainty reducing focus on strategic growth. Record fundraising support for fintechs from venture capital and private equity funds in hopes of finding the next unicorn anchored valuations at new heights in efforts to generate returns on portfolio winners, minting a new fintech ‘asset class’ even without many standout deals. Banks lacking the scale and capital to operationalize a diverse portfolio of acquired fintechs would be taking too high a risk on any one fintech asset and would not have the ability to readily sell the asset later to take advantage of the appreciation of the asset class as a whole. With valuations significantly decreasing, we would expect the market to clear through value-accretive deals at more realistic prices. This has not happened to date, in part due to fallout from the Spring 2023 banking crises and the uncertainty of the interest rate environment. Many banks remain focused on the potential for other bank acquisitions that allow them to achieve the scale necessary to overcome the expected cost of regulatory change. Energy otherwise spent for innovative inorganic growth is now focused on bank-bank M&A and ensuring that any future entities are positioned for regulatory approval. Banks need equity capital very dearly if they want to pay dividends and live in harmony with their regulators... There's an absolute ceiling where it's hard to imagine a bank spending $1 billion for a company that burns goodwill Fintech investor Due to the economic climate and continued evolution of consumer bankin",

This isn't just impressive numbers – it represents a fundamental shift in how financial services operate globally and how both businesses and consumers will interact with money. Looking at today's landscape, fintech currently captures just 2% of the massive $12.5 trillion global financial services revenue. However, this share is projected to more than triple to 7% by 2030 according to market data. The acceleration is already underway, with the global fintech market valued at approximately $194 billion in 2023 and expected to climb to $492 billion by 2028. Further evidence of this sector's momentum comes from public markets, where listed fintech companies reached a market capitalization of $550 billion as of July 2023 – double their value since 2019. These figures clearly demonstrate how rapidly fintech is advancing compared to traditional banking models. Regional trends show varying but universally strong growth patterns. Asia-Pacific stands to become the dominant fintech market by 2030, growing at an impressive 27% compound annual growth rate. North America isn't far behind, with projections showing fourfold growth to $520 billion in fintech revenue by 2030, accounting for 32% of global fintech revenue growth. The UK and European Union markets are also expected to expand more than fivefold compared to their 2021 levels. This industry-wide growth reveals a sector that's not just expanding – it's fundamentally reshaping the banking landscape for decades to come. Fintech Market Size and $1.5T Growth Projection by 2030 Financial technology companies are changing how money moves around the world with remarkable speed. The industry shows clear signs of extraordinary growth through 2030, challenging established financial institutions across every market segment. Global CAGR Estimates Across Fintech Segments The fintech ecosystem isn't growing uniformly – different segments show their own growth patterns through 2030. Payments, the original fintech success story, remains the frontrunner with projected annual revenue of $520 billion by 2030. This dominance reflects consumers worldwide increasingly choosing digital payment methods over traditional ones. Lending stands as another major growth segment, expected to reach $400 billion by 2030, completely transforming credit access for both individuals and businesses. Insurance and deposits aren't far behind, with forecasts of $200 billion and $155 billion respectively. These figures show how fintech innovation has expanded far beyond its initial focus. Some specialized segments show even more impressive trajectories: The B2B2X market (which helps other companies better serve their customers) should grow at 25% CAGR, hitting $440 billion by 2030 B2b solutions for underserved small businesses could grow even faster at 32% CAGR, potentially reaching $285 billion Research firms generally agree on the substantial growth picture, though their exact numbers differ slightly. Fortune Business Insights predicts a 17% CAGR from 2023-2030, while IndustryARC estimates a slightly higher 18.5% CAGR during roughly the same timeframe. Fintech Share in $12.5 Trillion Financial Services Market Fintech currently represents just 2% of the enormous $12.5 trillion global financial services revenue pool. This modest figure is set to more than triple to about 7% by 2030. Breaking this down by specific subsectors reveals an even more striking story. Banking-focused fintechs specifically should grow from 4% to 13% of banking revenue pools by 2030, achieving a 22% CAGR. These banking fintechs are on track to represent one-fourth of global banking valuations when this decade ends. Insurtech companies start from a smaller position at just 0.3% market penetration but should grow at 27% CAGR to capture 2% of insurance revenue pools. Revenue Growth vs Traditional Banking (2022–2030) The stark contrast between fintech and traditional banking growth rates tells the most compelling story. McKinsey's analysis shows fintech industry revenues growing almost three times faster than traditional banking between 2022 and 2028. In specific terms, fintechs are projected to achieve 15% annual revenue growth during this period, while traditional banking manages just 6%. Fintechs accounted for roughly 5% ($150-205 billion) of global banking sector net revenue in 2022. This share should exceed $400 billion by 2028, highlighting the continued rise of digital-first financial services . Traditional banking generated more than $6.5 trillion in revenues during 2022. Despite this massive lead in absolute numbers, fintech's triple-speed growth rate points to a fundamental transformation in how financial services reach consumers. The global banking and insurance revenue pool should grow to $21.9 trillion by 2030 (a 6% CAGR), with fintech claiming an increasingly larger piece of this expanding market. Segment-Wise Growth: Payments, B2B2X, and Lending Three distinct segments are powering the fintech industry's impressive growth trajectory through 2030: payments, B2B2X models, and lending solutions. Each of these areas shows unique growth patterns influenced by technological innovation and changing market needs. Digital Payments Expansion and Real-Time Use Cases Real-time payment systems have quickly transitioned from cutting-edge technology to essential financial infrastructure. The numbers t",
