Tweedledum and Tweedledee , fictional rivals from Lewis Carroll 's Through the Looking-Glass . [ 1 ] A rivalry is the state of two people or groups engaging in a lasting competitive relationship. Rivalry is the \"against each other\" spirit between two competing sides. The relationship itself may also be called \"a rivalry\", and each participant or side a rival to the other. Someone's main rival may be called an archrival .  A rivalry can be defined as \"a perceptual categorizing process in which actors identify which states are sufficiently threatening competitors\". [ 2 ] In order for the rivalry to persist, rather than resulting in perpetual dominance by one side, it must be \"a competitive relationship among equals\". [ 3 ] Political scientist John A. Vasquez has asserted that equality of power is a necessary component for a true rivalry to exist, but others have disputed that element. [ 4 ] Rivalries traverse many different fields within society and \"abound at all levels of human interaction\", [ 5 ] often existing between friends, firms, sports teams , schools , and universities . Moreover, \"families, politicians, political parties, ethnic groups, regional sections of countries, and states all engage in enduring rivalries of varying length and intensity\". [ 5 ] Rivalries develop from the product of competition and ritualism between different parties. In some cases, rivalry can become \"so consuming that actors worry only about whether their actions will harm or benefit their rivals\". [ 5 ] Origin and meaning [ edit ] Rivalry between France and Germany has existed as long as the two nations states have; here, officers from the Prussian Gardes du Corps, wishing to provoke war, sharpen their swords on the steps of the French embassy in Berlin in the autumn of 1806. [ 1 ] A rivalry generally refers to competition between people or groups, where each strives to be more successful than the other. [ 6 ] [ a ] Alternatively, and especially when used in the verb form (rivaled and rivaling in American English , and rivalled and rivalling in British English ) it may indicate a relationship of equality, as in \"the rival of their peers,\" \"a person without rival,\" or an \"unrivaled performance\". [ 6 ] The origin of the root rival comes from the Middle French and Latin rivalis , and the French rivus , meaning a person who drinks from or utilizes the same brook or stream as another. [ 8 ] : 404 [ 9 ] : 400 The word likely entered the English language around 1577, and appeared in the writings of William Shakespeare as early as 1623, in Two Gentlemen of Verona . [ 10 ] [ b ] In his 1902 Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology , James Mark Baldwin defined three main types of rivalry: biological rivalry, personal or conscious rivalry, commercial and industrial rivalry [ 11 ] Alternatively, Kilduff and colleagues in their 2010 review, instead divided among three types of competition (individual, group, and organization), and distinguished rivalry specifically as a \"subjective competitive relationship\" which necessarily entails \"increased\npsychological involvement and perceived stakes\". [ 7 ] More modern research has also identified similarity, proximity, and history of competition as necessary antecedents for the establishment of a rivalry, while others have suggested that incivility may reduce the need for a history of competition to solidify the rival relationship. [ 12 ] Archrival [ edit ] Where a person or entity has multiple rivals, the most significant one may be called an archrival . [ 13 ] In fiction, it is common for a recurring heroic character to have an archrival or archenemy to serve as a foil to the hero. However, an archrival may also be distinguished from a nemesis, with the latter being an enemy whom the hero cannot defeat (or who defeats the hero), even while not being a longstanding or consistent enemy to the hero. [ 14 ] Friendly rivalries [ edit ] A rivalry in which competitors remain at odds over specific issues or outcomes, but otherwise maintain civil relations, can be called a friendly rivalry . Institutions such as universities often maintain friendly rivalries, with the idea that \"[a] friendly rivalry encourages an institution to bring to the fore the very best it has to offer, knowing that if it is deficient, others will supersede it\". [ 15 ] In some instances, institutions such as corporations, sports leagues, or military units, may encourage friendly rivalries between subsets within that institution. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] For example, in the 1870s, the British Army held a sports competition in which individual military units selected members to compete against those selected by other units, for the purpose of engendering friendly rivalries between the units to promote internal cohesion. [ 17 ] Such rivalries may also be encouraged in order to prompt individual members of those subsets to compete more productively. Interservice rivalries can occur between different branches of a country's armed forces , arising from the competition for limited resources among a nation's land , naval , and air forces . [ 18 ] The term also applies to the rivalries between a country's intelligence services (e.g. CIA and FBI in the United States), or between the police and fire services of a city, such as the NYPD and FDNY . [ 19 ] Rivalry in specific fields [ edit ] Interpersonal relationships [ edit ] A variety of rivalries occur in interpersonal relationships. Sibling rivalry is a type of competition or animosity among siblings, whether blood related or not. Siblings generally spend more time together during childhood than they do with parents. The sibling bond is often complicated and is influenced by factors such as parental treatment, birth order , personality, and people and experiences outside the family. [ 20 ] Sibling rivalry is particularly intense when children are very close in age and/or of the same gender and/or where one or both children are intellectually gifted . [ 21 ] [ self-published source ] According to a review by Macionis, older siblings tend to report rivalry peaking in childhood, while younger siblings report a peak later during early adolescence. [ citation needed ] Rivalries also occur between people who have competing romantic interests in the same potential romantic partner: The jealousy mechanism is activated if a committed romantic relationship is threatened by a rival. ... In heterosexual relationships, the rival is an individual of the opposite sex; in homosexual relationships, the rival is of the same sex. The rival can be imagined, suspected, or real. The minim",

In economics , a good is said to be rivalrous or a rival if its consumption by one consumer prevents simultaneous consumption by other consumers, [ 1 ] or if consumption by one party reduces the ability of another party to consume it. A good is considered non-rivalrous or non-rival if, for any level of production, the cost of providing it to a marginal (additional) individual is zero. [ 2 ] A good is anti-rivalrous and inclusive if each person benefits more when other people consume it. A good can be placed along a continuum from rivalrous through non-rivalrous to anti-rivalrous. The distinction between rivalrous and non-rivalrous is sometimes referred to as jointness of supply or subtractable or non-subtractable . [ 3 ] Economist Paul Samuelson made the distinction between private and public goods in 1954 by introducing the concept of nonrival consumption. Economist Richard Musgrave followed on and added rivalry and excludability as criteria for defining consumption goods in 1959 and 1969. [ 4 ] Rivalry [ edit ] Most tangible goods, both durable and nondurable, are rival goods. A hammer is a durable rival good. One person's use of the hammer prevents others from using the hammer at the same time. However, the first user does not \"use up\" the hammer, meaning that some rival goods can still be shared through time. An apple is a nondurable rival good: once an apple is eaten, it is \"used up\" and can no longer be eaten by others. Non-tangible goods can also be rivalrous. Examples include the ownership of radio spectra and domain names . In more general terms, almost all private goods are rivalrous. Non-rivalry [ edit ] In contrast, non-rival goods may be consumed by one consumer without preventing simultaneous consumption by others. Most examples of non-rival goods are intangible. Broadcast television is an example of a non-rival good; when a consumer turns on a TV set, this does not prevent the TV in another consumer's house from working. The television itself is a rival good, but television broadcasts are non-rival goods. Other examples of non-rival goods include a beautiful scenic view , national defense, clean air, street lights, and public safety. More generally, most intellectual property is non-rival. In fact, certain types of intellectual property become more valuable as more people consume them ( anti-rival ). For example, the more people use a particular language , the more valuable that language becomes. Non-rivalry does not imply that the total production costs are low, but that the marginal production costs are zero. In reality, few goods are completely non-rival as rivalry can emerge at certain levels. For instance, use of public roads, the Internet, or police/law courts is non-rival up to a certain capacity, after which congestion means that each additional user decreases speed for others. For that, recent economic theory views rivalry as a continuum, not as a binary category , [ 5 ] where many goods are somewhere between the two extremes of completely rival and completely non-rival. A perfectly non-rival good can be consumed simultaneously by an unlimited number of consumers. Anti-rivalry [ edit ] Main article: Anti-rival good Goods are anti-rivalrous and inclusive if the consumer’s enjoyment increases with how many others consume the good. The concept was introduced by Steven Weber (2004), saying that when more people use free and open-source software , it becomes easier and more powerful for all users. [ 6 ] Lessig noted that any natural language is anti-rivalrous, because its utility increases with how much it is used by others. [ 7 ] Cooper noted that efforts to combat climate change are perversely anti-rivalrous — any country acting as a free rider will benefit from the efforts of others to combat this problem, even while not contributing itself.

    "raw_content": "Types of Rivalry Previous Section Table of Contents Next Section 7.1 Types of Rivalry We mostly think about rivalry Competition for the same goal, advantage, or resources. in the context of competitive markets for goods and services. Discussions of competitiveness often focus on high-level measures such as sales growth and market share. However, these are not factors over which we can have any direct effect, but are the results of success in winning, developing, and retaining important resources. Since most of what we know about rivalry comes from studies of price- and value-based markets, it is perhaps not surprising that customer markets grab all the attention. This focus has a most unfortunate consequence: competitive strategy Business strategy that focuses on actively seeking change within an organization's environments. seems to have little relevance for nonprofit sectors such as public services, the voluntary sector, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Yet nothing could be further from the truth; these organizations constantly compete for resources. Skilled staff are the obvious example, but supporters, cash, and other resources must also be battled for. Nevertheless, customers are still the most obvious resource that must be won and retained against rivals, so this is where we will focus first. However, most of the principles explained here are readily applicable to rivalry for staff and some other resources as well. There are three main forms of rivalry, which sometimes operate alone but more often play out alongside each other: Type 1: The battle to win new customers who do not yet buy your kind of product from anyone (potential customers). Type 2: The struggle to capture existing customers from rivals while keeping your own customers from switching to rivals. Type 3: The fight for the best possible share of business from customers who are not exclusively with you or anyone else. Let us see how these three mechanisms operate with a popular example. Barbie Fights for Her Crown For more than 40 years, Barbie dominated the kingdom of dolls. More than a billion Barbie dolls (including her relatives) have been sold since 1959. Mattel sells 1.5 million dolls every week in more than 140 countries. But Barbie’s undisputed reign was attacked by a new family of would-be royalty: the Disney Princesses. Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Tinkerbell, and their friends put aside their differences in a concerted attempt to win the hearts of children ages 3 to 7. During their most spectacular period of success, sales of Princesses grew from $136 million in 2001 to $700 million in 2002. Sales of Princess dolls alone were running at 4 million per year—already a substantial incursion into Barbie’s 75 million. So how did Barbie resist this attack on her supremacy? She had three battles to fight at once. First, she needed to keep winning the hearts of the youngest children buying a fashion doll for the first time (or persuading their parents to do so). Second, she needed to keep the loyalty of existing Barbie owners and hope they did not relegate her to the cupboard to make room for the Princesses. Third, she would have preferred not even to share space on the bedroom carpet with them. Barbie had limited resources: only so many sales and marketing people to defend her kingdom, only so much shelf space in stores where she could reach the children she wished to make her loyal owners, and only so much cash to spend on advertising, promotion, and pricing. If she did nothing, her position would continue to be eroded as the battle went against her on all three fronts. Type 1 Rivalry: Competing for Potential Customers As new potential customers develop, rivals fight to win them for their own business. They also seek to develop this potential pool of resources. Let us take a starting position in which Barbie has some 100 million active owners. Before the invasion of the Princesses, the situation was relatively stable; say she was winning about 20 million new owners a year but losing a similar number of older girls. Doll sales come both from first-time buyers and from repeat purchases by girls who already own Barbie. There is much additional revenue from sales of accessories, so if she loses this fight for doll sales, that income will also be lost. One scenario for this part of the Princesses’ incursion is that they quickly increase the fraction of small girls who choose them rather than Barbie as their preferred first-time fashion doll. Princess sales, too, will reflect both the rate at which first-time owners are buying these dolls and the repeat purchase rate from girls who already own one or more of the collection. If this scenario happens, the Princesses will succeed in taking a large part of Barbie’s domain without having to fight for her existing loyal owners at all ( Figure 7.1 \"Princesses Capture an Increasing Fraction of New Doll Owners\" ). Later, though, the novelty of being the first to own a Princess has faded so that new owners in 2 or 3 years’ time once again increasingly choose Barbie ( Figure 7.2 \"Barbie’s Loss of New Owners to the Princesses\" ). Figure 7.1 Princesses Capture an Increasing Fraction of New Doll Owners The following are two points to note: Children are slow to give up Princesses in these early years because relatively few have grown tired of them. Sales of dolls reflect both first-time purchases and additional dolls bought by children who already own one. With so many members of this extended royal family, these numbers could be large. The number of Barbie’s loyal owners would therefore be reduced by the same numbers as are won by the Princesses. The challenge for organizations that are developing potential customers is to understand what is driving customers’ choice of which “pipe” to flow through. Their choices will be driven by competitors’ decisions and actions, especially marketing and sales activities; relative price; relative perceived performance of competing products. Figure 7.2 Barbie’s Loss of New Owners to the Princesses To these can be added further mechanisms, such as word of mouth driving reinforcing growth—here, Princess owners encouraging their friends to buy Princesses too—and availability of Princesses in stores. Type 2 Rivalry: Competing for Rivals’ Customers Competitors battle to steal resources that have already been developed and are controlled by their rivals at the same time as they fight to prevent their own resources from being lured away. The rate at which customers choose to leave one firm for another reflects the comparison of price and benefits (value for money) between the rivals. This flow of customers between competing suppliers may, however, be moderated by switching costs. Barbie’s predicament would be still worse if, as well as losing out in the battle for new doll owners, she found that her existing owners started deserting her too. Again, we do not know how this trend might develop, but one scenario is that the fraction leaving her rises steadily through time ( Figure 7.3 \"A Rising Fraction of Barbie Owners Switches to Princesses\" ). Notice that the number of children switching per year stops growing in spite of the rising fraction who do so, simply because there are fewer left to be lost! Indeed, if we continued this scenario, the switching rate would drop to zero as the pool of former Barbie owners empties. We could speculate on all kinds of other scenarios. Barbie could, for example, see a rapid early loss as the least loyal Barbie owners switch, followed by a slowdown as only her most loyal subjects remain. The exact story behind the battle makes a big difference to how both Barbie and the Princesses should react. Figure 7.3 A Rising Fraction of Barbie Owners Switches to Princesses Type 2 rivalry has certain features that can be understood only by tracking and understanding what is driving these switch rates. First, switching accelerates as the customer benefits move further ahead of the cost of",

Log In rivalry noun ri·​val·​ry ˈrī-vəl-rē plural rivalries Synonyms of rivalry : the act of rivaling : the state of being a rival : competition Did you know? On Rivals , Rivaling , and Rivalry The word rival most commonly refers to a person or group that tries to defeat or be more successful than another person or group, which means that rivals tend to come in pairs. Candidates running for the same political office are political rivals, and two people trying to earn the exclusive affection of a third are romantic rivals. Teams, schools, or companies might be longtime rivals if they try over many years to outdo each other. Rival can also mean “equal” or “peer.” When the word is used in this way it's usually conveying how good or impressive something or someone is. For example, \"a country musician the rival of any in the world\" is as good as the best country musicians in the world. Often a negating word is added to assert superiority, as in \"a country musician without rival.\" As a verb, rival typically has a meaning that relates to this latter sense of the noun. The verb is most often used to say that someone or something possesses qualities or aptitudes that approach or equal those of another. For example, for one country musician to be rivaling another, the first country musician must be as good as or nearly as good as the other musician. (Note that in U.S. English, the verb's forms are usually spelled rivaled and rivaling ; in British English rivalled and rivalling are preferred.) The noun rivalry has to do with the state or situation in which rivals (usually in the “competitor” sense) exist, or in which rivaling happens. In politics we have political rivalries, and in matters of the heart there are romantic rivalries. Sibling rivalry exists when there is competition or jealousy between sisters or brothers.

According to Tyler & Cobbs (2017), rivalry is: Conflict with a highly salient outgroup that poses acute threat and enhancement to ingroup identity and/or esteem. What sparks a rivalry? A thorough explanation can be found in Tyler & Cobbs (2015) , but in short, 10 main ingredients fall into three categories: Conflict Conditions, Strong Similarity, and Deep Differences. CONFLICT CONDITIONS STRONG SIMILARITY DEEP DIFFERENCE Consistency: Frequent or recurring competition between the opponents Fan quote: “Twice a year every year since 1960” Conspicuous Moments: Memorable incident—positive or negative—between competitors Fan quote : “Dustin Brown’s hit on Rosival in 2011 playoffs” Conspicuous Characters: Extraordinary individuals (performers, personalities, legacies) Fan quote : “Brady vs. Manning” Competitiveness: Comparable success (recent/historic) or uncertainty of outcome Fan quote: “2 historically great teams” Spatial Proximity: Competitors are located close to each other Fan quote: “When you grow up with two schools in close proximity, you get a lot of arguing from peers” Synonymous Values/Appearance: Shared values/appearance between opponents or supporters Fan quote: “Similar institutions with similar missions and proud histories” Shared Supply Pool: Competition for labor talent and/or other resources Fan quote: “Both teams often recruit some of the same players in the Midwest Region” Dominance : One competitor aspires to overcome the historical success or dominance of the other Fan quote: “We usually get our asses kicked” Disparate Values/Appearance : Conflicting values/appearance between opponents or supporters Fan quote: “Islanders-Rangers rivalry is basically built on the blue-collar hardworkers versus the haughty rich city folk“ Discrimination by Authority : Perceived preferential treatment by competition regulators Fan quote: “League caters heavily to facilitate NYRB’s success” FOLLOW OUR WORK ON RESEARCHGATE What are rivalry points? To measure fans’ perceptions of rivalry, we provide our survey respondents with 100 ‘rivalry points’ to allocate across their favorite team’s opponents. We also ask respondents about their feelings and reactions toward rivals, as well as why their favorite team and the teams to which respondents allocate points should be considered rivals. What do the data mean? Rivalry Points: The survey asked respondents to allocate 100 “rivalry points” across opponents of their favorite teams. For instance, if John’s favorite team is the Springfield Isotopes, he may choose to allocate 60 points to the Shelbyvillians, whom he considers to be the Isotopes’s strongest rival, 30 points to the Norsemen, another opposing team he considers to be a rival of the Isotopes, and 10 points to the Woodchucks, a third opponent. Maria is another Isoptopes fan, and she chooses to allocate all 100 points to the Norsemen, the only team she considers to be a rival. The rivalry score is calculated by taking the average point total toward a rival from all a team’s respondents. The maximum rivalry score is 100, which would mean all respondents listed that team as the lone rival. In our example above, the rivalry score for the Norsemen would be 65, which is the average of John’s 30 points and Maria’s 100 points (Shelbyvillians = 30 points, Woodchucks = 5 points). The rivalry dyad score (or ‘aggregate score’) is calculated by adding respondents’ average rivalry score toward a particular opponent to the opposing average score of that opponent’s fans. In our example above, if the Norsemen fans held a rivalry score of 50 for the Isotopes, the rivalry dyad score for Isotopes-Norseman would be 115 (65 from Isotopes fans toward the Norseman, and 50 from the Norseman toward the Isotopes). The maximum aggregate score is 200, where all respondents of both teams allocated all 100 rivalry points to the same opponent, and every respondent of the opponent reciprocated with 100 points. The rivalry dyad difference (or ‘difference score’) is calculated by subtracting respondents’ average rivalry score toward a particular opponent from the opposing average score of that opponent’s fans. Continuing the same example from above, the rivalry dyad difference between the Isotopes and Norseman would be 15 (Isotopes 65 score toward Norseman subtracted from Norseman fans’ score of 50 toward Isotopes). For difference scores, larger numbers indicated more unbalanced rivalries, where one team’s fans are allocating many rivalry points to an opponent whose own fans do not reciprocate with a high allocation of their own rivalry points. How were the data collected? In August 2013, we began by surveying college football fans from Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS, or Division I-A) teams using on an online questionnaire posted on almost 200 fan message boards. In the Know Rivalry survey, we ask sports fans about ‘rivalry points,’ as well as respondent identification with the team, feelings and schadenfreude toward opponents and/or their fans, behavioral measures of bias, and basic demographic questions. In 2015-16, we expanded into professional sports by surveying fans across the five major professional leagues in the United States and Canada. To do so, we posted links to our surveys on fan message boards for every team in Major League Baseball (MLB), Major League Soccer (MLS), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), and the National Hockey League (NHL). Since then, we have continued to engage fans within these sports through additional rounds of data collection and expanding our reach beyond North America (n>50,000). We are grateful to all respondents who offered their perspectives as part of this ongoing research, and we look forward to continuing to share these findings for other researchers, practitioners, and fans.

The festivities begin Wednesday with a Matchday 13 battle between St. Louis CITY and Sporting Kansas City , before the weekend's Matchday 14 slate ends with a Sunday Night Soccer presented by Continental Tire doubleheader. Here's what's in store as rivalries â from their history to game-changing stars â get the league-wide spotlight. St. Louis CITY SC vs. Sporting Kansas City Matchday 13 WHEN: Wednesday, May 14 - 8:45 pm ET WHERE: Energizer Park | St. Louis, Missouri WATCH: Apple TV - MLS Season Pass, Apple TV+ ; FS1, FS2 This Midwest rivalry took flight in 2023 during St. Louis CITY's expansion season and has remained at fever-pitch levels, both due to proximity and genuine dislike between fan bases. SKC hold early-rivalry bragging rights, winning a Round One Best-of-3 Series 6-2 on aggregate in the Audi 2023 MLS Cup Playoffs. That came after STL topped the Western Conference standings as an expansion club, and the club has arguably never fully bounced back. These sides met just five weeks ago, with Sporting KC winning 2-0 at Children's Mercy Park behind Dejan JoveljiÄ 's brace. That result ignited the club's post-Peter Vermes era and prolonged their rival's early-season troubles. Series record: Sporting Kansas City lead 4W-2L-3D CF Montréal vs. Toronto FC Matchday 14 WHEN: Saturday, May 17 - 2:30 pm ET WHERE: Stade Saputo | MontrÃ©al, Quebec WATCH: Apple TV - MLS Season Pass In the not-too-distant past, the Canadian Classique was unquestionably among the top rivalries in MLS. While that status has slipped away as MontrÃ©al and Toronto stare up the Eastern Conference table, there's no shortage of passion on the pitch. Can MontrÃ©al find a path forward after an early-season coaching change saw Marco Donadel take over from Laurent Courtois? Will Toronto FC rally around stars Lorenzo Insigne and Federico Bernardeschi ? As those questions get answered, last month's Canadian Championship result lingers. These teams met in the Preliminary Round, with MontrÃ©al advancing on penalty kicks after goalkeeper Jonathan Sirois and striker Giacomo Vrioni emerged as heroes in a 2-2 draw. Series record: Toronto FC lead 26W-23L-10D New York City FC vs. New York Red Bulls Matchday 14 WHEN: Saturday, May 17 - 4:30 pm ET WHERE: Citi Field | Flushing, New York WATCH: Apple TV - MLS Season Pass, Apple TV+ From the infamous Red Wedding to last year's playoff showdown, the battle for New York has turned red more often than not. But the blue side of this rivalry has the ultimate bragging rights, with NYCFC winning MLS Cup 2021 on penalty kicks. Conversely, RBNY have twice come painstakingly close to lifting the Philip F. Anschutz Trophy â falling in MLS Cup 2024 and MLS Cup 2008. Before trophies get awarded this season, it's all about capturing momentum. RBNY lean on their one-two punch of Bundesliga veterans Emil Forsberg and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting , while Costa Rican international Alonso MartÃ­nez spearheads the NYCFC attack as a Golden Boot presented by Audi contender. Series record: New York Red Bulls lead 16W-10L-4D Columbus Crew vs. FC Cincinnati Matchday 14 WHEN: Saturday, May 17 - 7 pm ET WHERE: Lower.com Field | Columbus, Ohio WATCH: Apple TV - MLS Season Pass, Apple TV+ ; FS1, FOX Deportes Hell is Real is the MLS version of a heavyweight bout. Columbus enter with Diego Rossi and DÃ¡niel Gazdag leading the attack, looking to supply the final touch in head coach Wilfried Nancy's possession-based system. Cincinnati have Evander and KÃ©vin Denkey , two sharpshooters who can make the spectacular happen for Pat Noonan's team. As for which side wins this Eastern Conference headliner, it might just come down to defense. Cincy center back Miles Robinson hopes to represent the USMNT at this summer's Gold Cup , while Crew center back Steven Moreira is the reigning Defender of the Year. Series record: Columbus Crew lead 7W-3L-5D FC Dallas vs. Houston Dynamo FC Matchday 14 WHEN: Saturday, May 17 - 8:30 pm ET WHERE: Toyota Stadium | Frisco, Texas WATCH: Apple TV - MLS Season Pass With two decades of history, there's no shortage of iconic moments in the Texas Derby. And they typically center around who takes home El CapitÃ¡n â an 18th-century replica cannon â at season's end. FC Dallas have done the honors 11 times to Houston 's eight, including six of the last seven overall. They're poised to four-peat this year, after opening the season with a 2-1 victory at the Dynamo. With El CapitÃ¡n in their sights, can FC Dallas stars Petar Musa and Lucho Acosta close the deal? Or do Dynamo newcomers Jack McGlynn and OndÅej Lingr have a surprise in store? Series record: FC Dallas lead 20W-15L-20D Colorado Rapids vs. Real Salt Lake Matchday 14 WHEN: Saturday, May 17 - 9:30 pm ET WHERE: Dick's Sporting Goods Park | Commerce City, Colorado WATCH: Apple TV - MLS Season Pass Real Salt Lake have dominated the past decade of Rocky Mountain Cup fixtures, yet the Colorado Rapids enter as title-holders. That follows a turnaround campaign from Chris Armas' squad in 2024, with USMNT veterans Zack Steffen and Djordje Mihailovic reinvigorating the club alongside striker Rafael Navarro . If RSL are to wrangle back bragging rights, odds are star midfielder Diego Luna will step up for Pablo Mastroeni's team. While this Western Conference showdown can fly under the radar, magic often unfolds in these Mountain Time Zone fixtures. Series record: Real Salt Lake lead 30W-19L-13D Portland Timbers vs. Seattle Sounders FC Matchday 14 WHEN: Saturday, May 17 - 9:30 pm ET WHERE: Providence Park | Portland, Oregon WATCH: Apple TV - MLS Season Pass, Apple TV+ ; FS1, FOX Deportes A rivalry ripe with history, Portland and Seattle comprise two-thirds of the Cascadia Cup alongside Vancouver . But ask those in the Pacific Northwest which matchup contains the most bad blood, and you'll undoubtedly hear Timbers-Sounders. There's contempt among the fan bases, stretching back over five decades and numerous iterations of North American professional soccer. Add in their respective success â these clubs ran the Western Conference up until recently, combining to make every MLS Cup from 2015-21 (with two Seattle title victories along the way) â and the emotions grow stronger. If you're searching for game-changers, the Sounders mix their veteran core with young stars like homegrown midfielder Obed Vargas and DP attacker Pedro de la Vega . Meanwhile, the Timbers count on newcomer David Da Costa to pull the strings alongside Felipe Mora , Santiago Moreno & Co. Series record: Portland Timbers lead 20W-18L-10D Inter Miami CF vs. Orlando City SC Matchday 14: Sunday Night Soccer pres. by Continental Tire WHEN: Sunday, May 18 - 7 pm ET WHERE: Chase Stadium | Fort Lauderdale, Florida WATCH: Apple TV - MLS Season Pass, Apple TV+ Perhaps itâs simply bad blood. Maybe itâs the spotlight brought on by Messi & Friends. Heck, it could be the humidity. Whatever the answer is, Inter Miami and Orlando City turn the dial to 11 whenever they clash in the Florida Derby. For this yearâs first meeting, Miami are navigating through a rough patch where their Concacaf Champions Cup dream fell short and defensive",

Our fans, seeing them supporting and getting in the stadium was extraordinary. So, thank you so much, fans. Thank you so much for your energy. The boys were talking about it and I wanted to highlight that. So, regarding the game, I thought that we played very well offensively and defensively. What gave us the pace that we started the game with was that defensively we showed consistency and responsibility. â©All of what happened up front, for me, is a result of that collective effort that we had as a team. We played against a great rival, and tonight, having these three points and scoring in front of our fans, again, it was extraordinary. Fantastic night for us.â On the chemistry between forwards Luis Muriel and MartÃ­n Ojeda âThose chemistries, sometimes they come organically. As much as we want to coach and to be present in training and create sequences, the best you can have on a team is organic chemistry. Itâs something that comes from their communion on the pitch. Now theyâve found, in those moments, things that are hard to explain. But it's great to see and they know. I can see it on the training ground, I can see it in the locker room, so we hope for those chemistries to continue. Even the guys that are coming from the bench, they also show that. Because Ramiro [Enrique] is also in a good moment. But what is happening with MartÃ­n [Ojeda] and Luis [Muriel] up front, it is extraordinary. I think both of them are finding that connection that is making us much better than before.â On Tyrese Spicer making his Orlando City debut âFrom the first time that his name was brought up to us and the first time I saw him out on the training ground, I see great benefits for our team. Someone who can change the game with his pace and he knows about our ethics and working defensively. He will buy us a little bit of time for the youngsters that are coming, but they are in the process. Spicer already knows the league and so it is great news for our fans.â Orlando City SC Defender Robin Jansson Opening Statement âWe feel great, obviously. Good game, three points. Keeping the streak intact. Never lost to them here. We know that we're strong here when we play them. â©So, I'm super thankful to our fans for coming out to the stadium. It was electric tonight, incredible. We needed that. When we got to 1-0, it was a really good atmosphere around here, even before. Then they [Inter Miami CF] scored so quickly on us, which we didn't really like. But they brought us back up again and we moved on from there.â On the difference in the second half âWe know that we have good quality up [top] and we really took the chances that we had. They are always creating and are dangerous, and when we get that thing going, we can beat anyone. Also, we could have been a little better keeping the ball in the second half. I think that's something that we still have to work on because we've been struggling with it in the games before to keep it a little bit longer when we go up 2-1 or 3-1 instead of rushing forward. But overall, a good performance.\" On a rivalry win âThree points against your rival, it's super important. Itâs awesome. For us it doesn't matter who weâre facing, the other team. We focus on our team and try to put our team as high in the standings that we can, and that's what we focus on.â Orlando City SC Forward Luis Muriel On scoring a brace âIncredible. These are the weeks and the games you dream about as a player. It is a unique feeling and I feel spectacular to be able to help my team in the way that I am. To help us score goals, to help us win games like this. I hope that I can continue scoring and helping the team in the weeks to come.â On scoring the first goal of the game â[It felt] good. Incredible. To be able to score that early and more so because of the atmosphere in the stadium, how packed it was, the energy that the fans were bringing. It felt fantastic to score so quickly in a game, in an atmosphere like that. I hope that we're able to have the stadium like this in the games to come as we continue to push and fight for the title that so many people in Orlando want. It was fantastic tonight.â On his chemistry with MartÃ­n Ojeda âI think the chemistry thatâs there, MartÃ­n has with everybody. It's not just with me. He's having such an incredible season for Orlando. Heâs having such an incredible season for himself and every single moment from MartÃ­n can be magic. I think Iâm getting there as well. I'm having a great year for myself. Some moments better than others, such as right now, but I think it all stems from the work that we all do in training and the work that we do throughout the week. Hopefully we're able to keep it up.â Orlando City Communications - @OrlandoCitySC Orlando City News Matchday They Said It Luis Muriel Robin Jansson Copy URL Share on Facebook Share on X Related Stories Rapid Reactions: All bark, no bite Match report: Orlando City SC routs Inter Miami CF 4-1 Orlando City Starting XI: The Lions' lineup and bench as they host Inter Miami Club Sites Atlanta Atlanta Austin Austin Charlotte Charlotte Chicago Chicago Cincinnati Cincinnati Colorado Colorado Columbus Columbus Dallas Dallas D.C.
