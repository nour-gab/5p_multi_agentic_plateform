Companies are concerned that substitute products or services may displace their own. The threat of substitution is high when rivals, or companies outside the industry, offer more attractive and/or lower cost products. Buyers then have the opportunity to make a performance/price trade-off. The cost of switching is also a factor. If it is high, the threat of substitution is low. Questions to ask include: Is it easy for consumers to switch to another product/service? What are the major substitute products? What are the trends in market share of the product and its substitutes? What are the growth rates? What are the price/value characteristics? Are consumer preferences or consumer demographics changing?

The threat of substitutes is the availability of other products that a customer could purchase from outside an industry. The competitive structure of an industry is threatened when there are substitute products available that offer a reasonably close benefits match at a competitive price. In this case, price points are limited by the prices at which substitutes are available, thereby limiting the amount of profitability that can be generated within an industry. When there is a strong threat of substitutes, industry players must pay more attention to operating in the most efficient manner possible; otherwise, their high cost structures will interfere with profitability and may drive some firms out of business. When there is a reduced threat of substitutes, industry players tend to be more lax with their cost controls , resulting in higher prices charged to customers. Because there is little prospect of competition from outside the industry, there is a higher potential for profits within the industry. Thus, firms tend to generate higher profits at the expense of their customers. Related AccountingTools Course Business Strategy What Causes a Higher Threat of Substitutes? The following factors cause a higher threat of substitutes for an industry: Customers can easily switch between products. Substitute products are readily available to customers. Substitute products have better features than comparable products within the industry. Substitute products have higher quality/reliability than comparable products within the industry. Substitute products have lower costs than comparable products within the industry. Example of the Threat of Substitutes As an example of the threat of substitutes, a variety of online streaming platforms were able to substitute for the offerings of the traditional cable and satellite television companies. In this situation, customers were looking for entertainment and on-demand access to TV shows and movies. The streaming companies were able to meet this need at a lower cost, and provide it to consumers anytime, anywhere, and on different devices. Users were also able to choose subscriptions tailored to their preferences, and could view exclusive, high-quality content that was not available on traditional cable channels. The result of these substitutes was widespread cancellation of cable subscriptions in favor of streaming, resulting in a sharp drop in revenues for the cable companies. Many cable providers launched their own streaming services to remain competitive. This example highlights how substitutes can disrupt an entire industry, forcing existing players to innovate, diversify, or risk losing their market share. How to Reduce the Threat of Substitutes There are a number of ways in which a company can mitigate the threat of substitutes. For example, it can inspire brand loyalty through its marketing efforts, product quality, and support services. Or, it can focus intently on specific market niches, so that the value it offers to customers within those niches exceeds the value that customers can obtain from substitutes. Another possibility is to identify those customers who are most likely to shift to substitutes, and target them for enhanced service and marketing efforts, so that they are aware of the particular value that the organization brings to them. Yet another possibility is to lock in customers with systems that are specific to the company - such as by not using industry-standard specifications that would allow customers to easily swap in competing products. Investment Interpretation of the Threat of Substitutes From the perspective of an investment analysis, an industry is a better prospect for investment when the threat of substitutes is low, since firms within the industry have a higher potential to earn an above-average profit. An investor would want to watch for increases in the threat over time, since changes in this direction could lead to a decline of profitability within an industry, and therefore a decline in the value of the shares of businesses in that industry.

Our free online course Introduction to Market Sizing offers a practical 30-minute primer on market research and calculating market size. Threat of substitutes (from Porter’s five forces analysis ) occurs when companies within one industry are forced to compete with industries producing substitute products or services. Threat of substitutes is one of the five forces that determine the intensity of competition in an industry. The others are Barriers to entry Bargaining power of buyers Bargaining power of suppliers Industry rivalry Substitutes, potential returns, profits and competition Substitutes limit an industry’s potential returns by placing a ceiling on the prices that firms within that industry can charge to make a profit. As the price-performance alternative offered by substitutes becomes more attractive, it becomes even more difficult for those firms to make a profit. Demand for substitutes can also reduce the demand for industry products and services. Substitutes can create intense competition during normal economic times, and reduce potential profit increases during positive economic times. Identifying substitutes involves searching for other products or services that can perform the same function as the industry’s product or service. Positioning an industry’s products or services against the substitutes may take place via collective industry actions (for example, sustained advertising by industry participants). Key substitutes Substitute products that deserve the most attention include those: Subject to trends that improve their price-performance tradeoff with the industry’s product Produced by industries earning high profits—development increases competition in their own industries, causing price reduction or performance improvement Read next: Barriers to entry: Factors preventing startups from entering a market References Porter, M.

Martin, 2025 I had an interesting discussion about the role of substitutes in strategy at a client recently and thought would make sense to do a full Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) piece on the subject. It is called Substitutes & Strategy: Five Types, Five Distinct Strategic Imperatives . As always, you can find all the previous PTW/PI here . History of Substitutes in Strategy Michael Porter brought substitutes into the realm of strategy with his unveiling of the Five Forces model in his 1980 classic Competitive Strategy , in which one of those forces is Threat of Substitutes. He focused on substitution as a governor on the profitability of an industry, which is a key object of the Five Forces analysis. If an industry faces a high threat from substitute offerings — like steel facing the threat of substitution by aluminum or ceramics in certain uses — it would need to be more price competitive and (other things being equal) would experience lower profitability. If, in contrast, the substitute for a pharmaceutical drug is continued suffering and/or perishing, then the threat of substitutes is low, and the industry will be — guess what — highly profitable. The same logic applies to his Threat of New Entrants force — i.e. easy entry bad, difficult entry good. For what it is worth, I have always viewed the vertical axis of the Five Forces as determining how much value is available for the suppliers, firms competing, and buyers on the horizontal axis. And those horizontal forces (Supplier Power, Rivalry among Existing Competitors, and Buyer Power) will determine who gets what share of the value. High supplier power extracts profit out of the back of the industry. High buyer power extracts profit out of the front of the industry. And intense rivalry dissipates profits into thin air. For those who want a bit more background on the role of the Five Forces framework in strategy, I did a PTW/PI piece on it several years ago. Substitution & Growth Prospects The focus of this piece is how being a substitute offering relates to your growth prospects. The answer is that it really depends on the substitution context. Some contexts cause slower growth for the substitute against the established offer, while others offer the possibility for explosive growth. It is important to know in which context you are operating because the strategic imperatives differ greatly. I see five fundamentally different contexts for substitution. There may be more, but these are the ones that have meaningful differential strategy implications for me. 1) From Unpaid to Paid Task Sometimes the substitute compels customers to pay for a task that was previously either not done at all or done without an outlay of cash. The former category includes going to the dentist versus doing without. To use the substitute for doing without, the customer must pay for something not previously paid for. The latter category includes buying and using an automatic dishwasher to substitute for handwashing dishes or going to the nail salon instead of doing your own nails. The challenge here for the substitute is that potential customers must reallocate cash from some other use to dedicate to your use. That will slow substitution. All customers won’t immediately say: “Wow, that solution is great; I will buy now .” For example, it took 40 years for the automatic dishwasher to reach 50% US penetration. The strategic imperative in this context is to help the potential users understand the value of the substitute to them and to be careful about building capacity too far ahead of demand. Demand will grow steadily if the substitution creates true user value — as with automatic dishwashers. Of course, the better the value equation for the user, the faster the substitution, so costs do matter. But costs don’t matter as much as making the value compellingly clear to the user — so that the user is compelled to make the needed new investment in the task. 2) Already Paid, but Gated by Infrastructure For some substitutes, the user already pays for the task — which is good because investment is already allocated to the task — but the substitute’s adoption is gated by the necessary infrastructure. This was the case for television as a substitute for radio. It was a superior substitute for many, though not all, uses. However, it took a while to penetrate fully. A reason was that television penetration was gated by the content infrastructure. When television came to be, there was little video content for television. That infrastructure had to be built to make the television a valuable substitute for radio. It became the gating function for the substitution of television for radio. The strategic imperative in this kind of substitution is that the provider takes responsibility for ameliorating or eliminating the infrastructure gating function. That happened in television as the leading television manufacturers, RCA and General Electric, made huge investments in content creation. For example, RCA created NBC to generate content. In the modern world, Tesla has had to invest in creating a charger infrastructure to spur substitution of electric vehicles (EV) for internal combustion engine vehicles (ICE) — which is smart strategy. 3) Already Paid, but Gated by Costs For other substitutes, the rate of substitution is gated by its cost — and therefore the price at which the substitute can be offered. This is the case for the EV versus ICE substitution above. Customers are already paying for ICE vehicles — which is good for the substitute, EV. But (currently) the cost of an EV makes the price to customers sufficiently high that the substitution is slow — it is gated by costs. (Note, this is not the case in China where low-cost/low-price EVs are abundant, have high penetration — and are a looming threat to American producers). In the US, the dominant proportion of EVs sold are currently in the ‘luxury’ category because of the costs/prices of this substitute, and luxury vehicle sales make up under 20% of vehicle sales in the US market. That is a substitution gating — and the reason for the electorate’s lack of enthusiasm for the 2021 EV mandate. That having been said, substitution of EV for ICE is most certainly happening, driven by Tesla. Another cost-gated substitution was solar power substitution for conventional power. Solar was once severely gated by costs — which for conventional power was cheaper. But over two decades, solar power (in some but far from all circumstances) has been cost-reduced to the extent that it ceased to be a cost-gated substitute. And that illustrates the strategic imperative for cost-gated substitutes for existing paid-for alternatives. You simply must get your costs down to drive speed of substitution. Without cost proximity, you will be a fringe player/industry forever — often dependent on regulatory mandates for customer use. 4) Already Paid and Ungated — but You are the Incumbent In some situations, the incumbent develops a substitute for its own offering. I have been close to two of these. When I went on the board of Thomson-Reuters, its Westlaw business had a hugely successful business as the dominant supplier of case law books to legal libraries. For every case that came out of the US legal system, Westlaw created a short summary of it (a ‘headnote’) and had a proprietary numbering system that categorized the content of each case in a way that helped law librarians (which every firm had one or more of) find the case law relevant to a partner’s current case. When the Internet came along, clever folks at Westlaw figured out that a fa",

Share This... Threat of Substitutes The “threat of substitutes” is one of the five forces in Michael Porter’s Five Forces framework, which is a tool used to analyze the competitive environment and attractiveness of an industry. This framework helps businesses understand the external forces that might impact their profitability. The threat of substitutes refers to the potential for alternative products or services to fulfill a similar need or function as the product or service offered by companies within an industry. If customers have the option to choose from several substitute products that offer a similar benefit, then the industry’s profitability can be threatened. Factors that influence the threat of substitutes: Price and Quality of Substitutes : If substitutes are more affordable and/or of higher quality than the industry’s product, they pose a stronger threat. Switching Costs : If it’s easy and cost-effective for customers to switch to substitutes, then the threat is higher. Conversely, high switching costs can deter customers from choosing substitutes. Consumer Tendencies : If consumers are prone to experimentation or are not brand loyal, they might easily shift to substitutes. Perceived Level of Differentiation : If consumers see the industry’s product as highly unique or specialized, substitutes might pose a lower threat. However, if many similar products can fulfill the same need, the threat is higher. Availability : If substitutes are readily available and accessible to consumers, they can pose a higher threat. Example of the Threat of Substitutes Let’s delve into an example from the entertainment industry, specifically the market for home video entertainment. Traditional Cable TV vs. Streaming Services A few years back, many households primarily relied on traditional cable or satellite TV for home entertainment. This was the norm, and while there were other methods of watching shows and movies, like DVD rentals, cable was the dominant player for real-time broadcasting and a variety of channels. Threat of Substitutes : Emergence of Streaming Services : Platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video started offering a wide variety of shows and movies on-demand. Viewers could watch their desired content at any time, without ads, and often at a lower monthly price than a cable subscription. Price and Quality : For a fixed, often lower monthly fee compared to cable, users could access vast libraries of content. Plus, streaming services started producing high-quality original content, making them even more attractive. Switching Costs : The cost and hassle of switching from cable to a streaming service were minimal. With many modern TVs equipped for internet connectivity and devices like Roku or Chromecast available, setting up a streaming account became easy. Canceling a cable subscription and switching to streaming didn’t entail significant costs or technical challenges for most users. Consumer Tendencies : With the rise of mobile devices and changing viewing habits, especially among younger demographics, there was a shift towards on-demand consumption rather than being tied to a TV schedule. Perceived Level of Differentiation : Streaming platforms allowed users to customize their viewing experience, without ads, and offered unique content that wasn’t available on cable. Availability : High-speed internet became more widespread and affordable, making streaming a feasible option for more and more households. Given these factors, streaming platforms emerged as a significant substitute for traditional cable TV. As a result, the cable TV industry saw “cord-cutting” become a trend, where many households canceled their cable subscriptions in favor of one or more streaming services. In this scenario, traditional cable TV providers faced the profound threat of substitutes, challenging them to adapt by offering their streaming platforms, bundling services, or partnering with existing streaming giants.

This sometimes requires an ability to assess and communicate market dynamics in a clear and meaningful way. One classic tool that I use to frame market dynamics is Porter’s Five Forces . If you’ve worked in procurement as long as I have, you’ve most likely come across it many times and might even question if it is still relevant. (Hint: it most certainly is!) Let’s go through practical tips on how to align Porter’s Five Forces to some of the common challenges faced by procurement teams. After we’ve covered some essential definitions we’ll go through how the framework can be applied to strategic sourcing , category management and supplier relationship management. Recap on Porter’s 5 Forces Porter’s Five Forces is a framework for analyzing the competitive landscape of an industry by examining the threat of new entrants, bargaining power of suppliers and buyers, threat of substitutes, and rivalry among existing competitors. First introduced in 1979 by Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter in his Harvard Business Review article “ How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy ,” this framework provides a structured approach to analyzing the competitive forces at play within any industry. Porter’s Five Forces has been taught in universities for decades and is one of the most recognized strategic management frameworks. Here is how you can see these from the perspective of a modern procurement organization. Threat of new entrants This force examines how easily new competitors can enter the market you operate within. A market with high barriers to entry (e.g., high capital investment, strict regulations, strong brand loyalty) is less susceptible to new competitors, potentially giving existing suppliers more power. Conversely, a market with low barriers to entry increases competition, often leading to better prices and more favorable terms for procurement. Bargaining power of suppliers This force examines the influence suppliers have on price and availability. Suppliers hold significant power when there are few alternatives, offer unique products or services, or when switching suppliers is costly. Strong supplier power can impact a buyer’s profitability and flexibility. Bargaining power of buyers This force analyzes the influence you as a buyer have on price and terms. Buyers gain leverage when they purchase large volumes, have multiple sourcing options, or when they account for a large portion of the sales of a supplier. Strong buyer power is usually favorable for procurement. It can help secure favorable pricing and preferential contract terms. Threat of substitute products or services This force considers how easily customers can switch to alternative products or services that fulfill the same need. The threat is high when substitutes are readily available, offer significant price advantages, or when switching costs are low. If the threat of substitutes is high it may be difficult to justify higher prices. Rivalry among existing competitors This central force analyzes the overall intensity of competition within an industry. High rivalry, driven by factors like numerous competitors, slow market growth, or high exit barriers, can result in price competition and the commoditization of different solutions. Porter’s Five Forces in Strategic Sourcing Porter’s Five Forces can give a balanced understanding of market dynamics to help you describe and drive value beyond simple cost reduction. For this reason, it can be applied to different tasks and steps of your strategic sourcing processes . Define your category profile You can use the Five Forces framework to describe competitive market trends in your category profile . When you’re doing this you don’t need to go into great detail. Simply describe the current snapshot “as-is” state of the competitive landscape and what factors procurement organizations need to keep in mind on a high level. Anticipate market disruptions Too often procurement is seen as a function that looks in the rearview mirror. You can use Porter’s Five Forces to build a view of future needs and market trends. Here you can explore emerging technologies, business models, and alternative solutions that could disrupt existing supply chains. This awareness allows you to be ahead of innovations and mitigate the risk of being locked into outdated agreements. Describe supplier dynamics As a procurement leader you sometimes need to be able to step into the shoes of your suppliers. Porter’s Five Forces can be a way to describe the relative position and motivations of key suppliers. In scenarios where supplier power is high, characterized by limited supplier options or unique offerings, procurement should prioritize building strategic partnerships. Conversely, when buyer power is dominant, procurement can leverage its position to negotiate favorable pricing, payment terms, and contractual agreements. If you want to go further in assessing the needs of your suppliers you can consider building an additional supplier preferencing matrix . Build the case for change in strategy Porter’s Five Forces can also help build the case for a shift in sourcing strategy. It gives executives and key stakeholders a clear and easy-to-understand framework to reflect on changing market dynamics. For example, you can use it to show changes in supplier power, the emergence of disruptive new entrants or substitutes, or the impact of intensifying competitive rivalry on pricing. Uses for Five Forces in Category Management You don’t need to limit the use of this framework to strategic sourcing projects. Porter’s Five Forces can also be a framework to inspire aspects of your broader category strategy . (Re-)assess your category taxonomy You can analyze the differences in supplier power, threat of new entrants, and competitive rivalry within specific categories or sub-categories to get a broader perspective on where to focus your time. This could help prioritize resources towards categories with more favorable market dynamics where you can secure better value. Informed supplier relationships You can have open and transparent discussion",

Managers use it to better understand and counter the threats their company is facing. While it is rare for a company to be the only player in its industry, other market players are not the only threat to a successful business: Technologies may change, new entrants may pose a threat and suppliers may raise their prices to increase profits. Successful businesses thrive because they identify and counter these threats early and effectively. So today, we’re taking a closer look at Michael E. Porter’s 5 Forces Model and how it can help you identify the threats to your business from your industry. This article will cover: Definition of Porter’s 5 Forces Competitive rivalry Threat of new entrants Threat of substitutes Bargaining power of suppliers Bargaining power of buyers Conclusion What are Porter’s 5 Forces? First published in the Harvard Business Review in 1979, Michael E. Porter’s 5 Forces Analysis serves as a framework to analyse and measure an industry’s attractiveness based on the degree of its competitive intensity. Porter’s basic assumption is that the external market structure is the main determinator of an industry’s attractiveness. Consequently, these industrial factors drive companies to continuously monitor their economic environment and take it into account in their strategic planning . As a result, a company’s success or failure indirectly depends on its surrounding market structure. Porter defines a total of five forces (5-Forces) that company’s need to consider when carrying out a systematic competitive analysis: The existence of existing competition in an industry (competitive intensity & rivalry) The threat of potential competitors entering the market The threat of substitutes The bargaining power of suppliers The bargaining power of buyers But before the individual forces can be analysed, the sector or industry under consideration must be clearly defined. Only then can data be effectively collected and reliably used for a company’s decision-making. Finally, the 5 Forces Analysis leads to an assessment of the threats posed by potential competitors and substitutes, as well as the bargaining power of suppliers and customers. The results can be used to derive whether and to what extent the industry under consideration is attractive for a company. As such, the 5 Forces is also an ideal framework for evaluating potential investment strategies. Competitive rivalry & intensity The main purpose of the 5 Forces Analysis is to assess the competitive situation in an industry. Central questions about the number of competitors and the nature of potential threats need to be answered. High competition intensity can result from two main factors: Price competition and performance competition. Price competition refers to market players trying to undercut each other with lower prices by increasing the efficiency in their value chain. Performance competition focuses on product quality and additional service offerings instead of price. The intensity of an industry’s competition can be evaluated with the following parameters: The number of competitors: The higher the number of competitors, the greater the intensity of competition. Profit margins tend to be low, and production takes place at marginal cost. Industry growth: Emerging markets are often characterised by rapid growth and offer the advantage that only a few experts can compete with existing offerings. Stagnating or shrinking markets offer less potential, as competition has matured and customer expectations are clearly defined. Product differentiation: The greater the differentiation of products, the lower is usually the intensity of competition. Products are more difficult to compare and have unique characteristics. Market demand: The ratio between supply and demand provides information about the utilisation and available capacities on the market. If supply is greater than demand, the individual market players will fight more intensively for their market share to achieve higher utilisation rates. In this case, the attractiveness level of an industry drops sharply. Exit barriers: If it is difficult or costly to leave an industry, firms will remain and add to the intensity of competition by trying to secure their market share. Examples of highly competitive industries Grocery Retailing. In the UK alone, customers can choose from over 87,000 physical grocery stores. That’s why price competition is fierce, and retailers have to focus on cutting down costs to attract customers into their stores. Note that the above figures do not consider the recent rise of online grocery shops, putting additional pressure on the industry. Air travel. The airline industry is another example of an industry with fierce competition. Budget airlines like Ryanair or EasyJet have long become a substantial threat to premium brands like Lufthansa or British Airways. This has led to an overall decrease in ticket prices, which for many routes has led to a race to the bottom. The long list of airlines that have had to file for bankruptcy over the years is just another proof that doing business in this industry is not for the faint-hearted. Threat of new entrants New entrants pose another threat to existing businesses in an industry. Innovative and quickly growing niches naturally draw the attention of others who may be attracted to launch similar products or services. But even established markets are not excluded from this threat. Assessing the risk of new entrants is critical, as potential competitors may be about to target the same customer segments that are important to existing brands in the market. New entrants often develop more efficient value chains and exploit their flexibility over large corporations to offer better services. It is not uncommon for new entrants to take advantage of these lower production costs. It allows them to offer their product at a lower price with the same or even better quality than existing solutions. To better evaluate the threat of new market entrants, it makes sense to assess an industry’s entry and exit barriers: Evaluating Market Entry Barriers If the costs to enter a market are tied to high investments, the market entry barriers are relatively high. Contrary, the probability of new firms entering the market is low if there are high market exit barriers . This could be due to long-term contractual commitments or generally long payback periods for larger investments. Markets are also seen as difficult to enter if current players hold patents or the market is regulated by governments . Typical examples of markets with high entry barriers can be found in the arms or pharmaceutical industry. Threat of substitutes Another threat is the one of substitution. It is one of the most underestimated factors in any competitive analysis. A substitute is an offer that replaces the existing products on the market. The modern age has seen many pivotal shifts with the rise of new technologies, better infrastructure and the increase of wealth in Western countries. As such, innovations are part of our modern society but can pose an existential risk to entire industries. The challenge many managers face is to accurately assess the risk these innovations pose to their business model. This is especially true for industries that are not used to regular innovation cycles. Examples of substitutes Amazon’s Kindle . Released in 2007, the e-reader of retail giant Amazon was laughed at by established publishers in the book industry. They didn’t realize the threat that the device would pose to their business model, as they did not think that customers would pref",

One way to achieve this is by using Porter's Five Forces Framework, a valuable tool for analyzing the competitive forces at work in your industry. In this article, I'll explain the Five Forces and show you how to apply them with practical examples. #strategy #competitivestrategy #analysis #planning #competition #5forces Understanding Porter's Five Forces Framework The Five Forces Framework was developed by Michael Porter, a renowned professor at Harvard Business School, in order for businesses to identify the forces that affect their industry's competitive environment. By understanding these forces, companies can develop strategies to gain a competitive advantage. The Five Forces are: Threat of New Entrants: This force refers to how easy or difficult it is for new competitors to enter your industry. Factors like regulations, economies of scale, and brand recognition can all impact the level of threat. Bargaining Power of Suppliers: How much leverage do suppliers have over your industry? Suppliers with significant bargaining power can dictate prices and other terms, which can impact profitability. Bargaining Power of Buyers: Just as suppliers, buyers can have leverage over your industry too. Buyers with significant bargaining power can demand lower prices or better terms, also impacting profitability. Threat of Substitutes: How easy or difficult it is for customers to switch to alternatives to your product or service? Factors like price, quality, and convenience can all impact the level of threat. Intensity of Competitive Rivalry: The final force refers to the level of competition in your industry. High levels of competition can lead to price wars and reduced profitability. Pros and cons of using Five Forces On the positive side, Five Forces analysis helps us to understand how value is shared amongst competitors in an industry and it can be used as a great base for formulating competitive strategy. Furthermore, it is an external analysis of the organization's environment, making its implications broader and a way to determine industry developments. When using the framework, however, you should be aware that industry-based focus does not take into consideration international resources and competencies that have helped shape the specific industry. Additionally, the framework assumes \"a standstill\" in the external environment, and therefore does not apply well to industries with a lot of regulatory changes. Applying the Five Forces Framework To apply the Five Forces Framework, start by identifying the factors that affect each force in your industry. Then, assess the level of impact of each factor on your business. Finally, use this information to develop a strategy that leverages your company's strengths and weaknesses. Here is a practical example of how to apply the Five Forces Framework: Example: The Soft Drink Industry Threat of New Entrants: The soft drink industry has high barriers to entry due to significant brand recognition  (think Coca-Cola) and economies of scale. This makes it challenging for new competitors to enter the market. Bargaining Power of Suppliers: The soft drink industry relies heavily on sugar suppliers. However, there are many suppliers, so their bargaining power is relatively low. Bargaining Power of Buyers: Soft drink buyers have significant bargaining power due to the abundance of substitute products like water, juice, and tea. This makes it challenging for companies to maintain high prices. Threat of Substitutes: The threat of substitutes is high in the soft drink industry. Customers can easily switch to other beverages, making it essential for companies to maintain brand loyalty and quality. Intensity of Competitive Rivalry: The soft drink industry is highly competitive, with companies engaging in frequent price wars to gain market share. Implications of the Five Forces on Business Strategy Once businesses have a clear understanding of the five forces at play in their industry, they can use this knowledge to develop effective business strategies. Creating competitive advantage: By identifying areas where they have a unique advantage, businesses can develop strategies to leverage those strengths and differentiate themselves from competitors. For example, a business with a proprietary manufacturing process might focus on quality or customization to set itself apart from competitors. Mitigating competitive threats: By understanding the factors driving competition in their industry, businesses can develop strategies to counteract those threats. If a business is facing increased competition from substitute products, it might focus on improving the customer experience or offer additional value-add services to retain customers. Identifying potential opportunities: By understanding the factors driving new entrants or substitute products, businesses can identify potential opportunities for growth or expansion. A company operating in a highly-regulated market might look for opportunities to innovate or disrupt the market by offering a new, more efficient approach. Informing resource allocation: By understanding the competitive landscape, businesses can make informed decisions about where to allocate resources such as marketing spend or research and development. For example, a business facing intense competition from multiple players might prioritize investing in product development to improve its offering and stand out in the market. In summary Overall, Porter's Five Forces is a valuable framework for businesses looking to understand the competitive landscape of their industry and develop effective business strategies. By identifying the key forces at play, businesses can make informed decisions about how to position themselves for success.

One tool that can help you analyse the competitive forces in your market is Porter’s Five Forces. Developed by Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter in the 1980s, Porter’s Five Forces is a framework used to evaluate the intensity of competition in an industry and the potential for profitability. By understanding the five forces, businesses can identify the key drivers of competition and make informed decisions about positioning themselves in the market. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll cover the basics of Porter’s Five Forces and how you can use them to analyse the competitive forces in your industry. By the end of this article, you’ll have a solid understanding of the five forces and how to use them to develop a winning business strategy. Threat Of New Entrants One of the forces that can affect the intensity of competition in an industry is the threat of new entrants. New entrants can disrupt existing competitors by offering new products or services, entering the market with lower prices, or utilising innovative business models. This can increase competition and pressure existing firms to adapt or lower their prices. Several factors can make it difficult for new entrants to enter and compete successfully with established firms. These include: High barriers to entry: Some industries have high barriers to entry that make it difficult for new firms to enter the market. These barriers include regulatory barriers, such as licensing requirements or strict regulations, and economic barriers, such as high upfront costs or the need for specialised equipment or technology. Strong brand recognition : Established firms often have strong brand recognition and loyalty among customers, making it difficult for new entrants to gain a foothold in the market. Economies of scale: Firms that have already achieved economies of scale – the cost advantages that come with producing at a large scale – may have a cost advantage over new entrants, making it difficult for new firms to compete on price. Threat Of Substitutes Another force to consider when analysing the intensity of competition in an industry is the threat of substitutes. Substitutes are products or services used in place of a particular product or service. For example, bottled water is a substitute for tap water, and streaming services are a substitute for cable television. The availability of substitutes can affect the demand for a particular product or service and pressure firms to lower their prices. Several factors can make it difficult for substitutes to enter the market: High switching costs: If customers face high costs to switch to a substitute product or service, such as purchasing new equipment or cancelling a subscription, they may be less likely to switch. Strong brand loyalty: If customers are loyal to a particular brand or product, they may be less likely to switch to a substitute. Bargaining Power Of Buyers The bargaining power of buyers, or the ability of customers to negotiate for lower prices or better terms, is another force to consider when evaluating the intensity of competition in an industry. If buyers have a lot of bargaining power, they can pressure firms to lower their prices or offer additional benefits to win their business. Several factors can give buyers more bargaining power: Availability of substitutes: If customers have several options, they may be more likely to negotiate for better terms or switch to a substitute product. Importance of the product to the buyer: If the product or service is essential to the buyer’s business or daily life, they may have more bargaining power. Number of buyers in the market: If there are many buyers in the market, firms may be more willing to negotiate to win their business. Bargaining Power Of Suppliers In addition to considering the bargaining power of buyers, businesses should also consider the bargaining power of suppliers. Suppliers can affect the prices and terms of the products or services they provide, and if they have a lot of bargaining power, they can pressure firms to pay higher prices or accept less favourable terms. Several factors can give suppliers more bargaining power: Availability of substitutes: If there are few substitutes for a supplier’s products or services, they may have more bargaining power. Importance of the supplier’s product to the buyer: If the supplier’s product is essential to the buyer’s business, the supplier may have more bargaining power. Concentration of suppliers in the market: If there are few suppliers in the market, they may have more bargaining power. Rivalry Among Existing Competitors The intensity of competition among existing competitors in an industry is another factor to consider when evaluating the potential for profitability. If there is a lot of rivalry among competitors, firms may be pressured to lower their prices, increase their marketing efforts, or introduce new products to stay competitive. There are several factors that can increase rivalry among existing competitors, including: Excess capacity: If there is more capacity in the market than in demand, firms may be more likely to compete aggressively to increase their market share. High fixed costs: If firms have high fixed costs, such as leasing a facility or purchasing equipment, they may be more likely to compete aggressively to recoup their costs. Intense price competition: If firms are competing primarily on price, they may be more likely to engage in price wars or other aggressive pricing strategies. Porter’s Five Forces In Online Retailing Threat of new entrants: The threat of new entrants in the online retailing industry is moderate. While the barriers to entry are relatively low – any individual or company can set up an e-commerce website with relatively little upfront investment – there are still some barriers to consider. For example, new entrants may face challenges in establishing a strong brand recognition and building a customer base and competing with established firms that already have economies of scale and strong customer loyalty. Threat of substitutes: The threat of substitutes in the online retailing industry is low. While customers can purchase products from physical stores or other online retailers, the convenience and wide selection of products offered by online retailers make them a strong choice for many customers. In addition, the high switching costs associated with changing online retailers – such as updating payment information and shipping addresses – may discourage customers from switching to substitutes. Bargaining power of buyers: The bargaining power of buyers in the online retailing industry is high. With the abundance of options available, customers can shop around and compare prices and negotiate for discounts or promotions. In addition, using price comparison websites and quickly checking prices on multiple sites gives buyers more bargaining power. Bargaining power of suppliers: The b",

Well, non-standardized products means that the products differ; like an xbox vs PS4. Then I'd think; \"there's high rivalry between those two products\". Or maybe I'd think that because there's high-technology requirements, that it must be hard to enter the industry, meaning that there's a low threat of substitutes. But nope!

First described by Michael Porter in his classic 1979 Harvard Business Review article, Porter’s insights started a revolution in the strategy field and continue\n            to shape business practice and academic thinking today. \n            \t\t\t\t\t\tA Five Forces analysis can help companies assess industry attractiveness, how\n            trends will affect industry competition, which industries a company should compete\n            in—and how companies can position themselves for success. Threat of New Entrants The threat of new entrants into an industry can force current players to keep\n            prices down and spend more to retain customers. Actually, entry brings new capacity\n            and pressure on prices and costs. \n            \t\t\t\t\t\tThe threat of entry, therefore, puts a cap on the profit potential of an industry.\n            \n            \t\t\t\t\t\tThis threat depends on the size of a series of barriers to entry, including\n            economies of scale, to the cost of building brand awareness, to accessing distribution\n            channels, to government restrictions. The threat of entry also depends on the capabilities of the likely potential\n            entrants. \n            \t\t\t\t\t\tIf there are well established companies in the industry operating in other geographic\n            regions, for example, the threat of entry rises. Bargaining Power of Suppliers Companies in every industry purchase various inputs from suppliers, which account\n            for differing proportions of cost. Powerful suppliers can use their negotiating leverage\n            to charge higher prices or demand more favorable terms from industry competitors,\n            which lowers industry profitability. \n            \t\t\t\t\t\tIf there are only one or two suppliers of an essential input product, for example,\n            or if switching suppliers is expensive or time consuming, a supplier group wields\n            more power. Bargaining Power of Buyers Powerful customers can use their clout to force prices down or demand more service\n            at existing prices, thus capturing more value for themselves. Buyer power is highest\n            when buyers are large relative to the competitors serving them, \n            \t\t\t\t\t\tproducts are undifferentiated and represent a significant cost for the buyer,\n            and there are few switching costs to shifting business from one competitor to another.\n            \n            \t\t\t\t\t\tThey can play rivals against each other—especially if an industry’s products\n            are undifferentiated, it’s inexpensive to switch loyalties, and price trumps quality. There may be multiple buyer segments in a given industry with different levels\n            of power. Threat of Substitute Products or Services A substitute is another product or service that meets the same underlying need\n            that the industry’s product meets in a different way. Videoconferencing is a substitute\n            for travel. Email is a substitute for express mail. The threat of a substitute is high if it offers an attractive price-performance\n            trade-off versus the industry’s product, especially if the buyer’s cost of switching\n            to the substitute is low. Rivalry Among Existing Competitors If rivalry is intense, it drives down prices or dissipates profits by raising\n            the cost of competing. Companies compete away the value they create. \n            \t\t\t\t\t\tRivalry tends to be especially fierce if: Competitors are numerous or are roughly equal in size and market position Industry growth is slow There are high fixed costs, which create incentives for price cutting Exit barriers are high Rivals are highly committed to the business Firms have differing goals, diverse approaches to competing, or lack familiarity with\n                     one another First described by Michael Porter in his classic 1979 Harvard Business Review article, Porter’s insights started a revolution in the strategy field, and continue\n            to shape business practice and academic thinking.\n            \t\t\t\t\t\tA Five Forces analysis can help companies assess which industries to compete\n            in—and how to position themselves for success. Key Industry Structure Concepts Every industry is different, but the underlying drivers of profitably are the same in every industry. Share This: The Five Forces determine the competitive structure of an industry, and its profitability. Industry structure, together with a company's relative position within the industry, are the two basic drivers of company profitability. Share This: Analyzing the Five Forces can help companies anticipate shifts in competition, shape how industry structure evolves, and find better strategic positions within the industry. Share This: How the Five Forces Work Read full analysis on International Air Transport Association Vision 2050 Industry Structure is Dynamic Industry structure changes over time, and is not static. Over time, buyers or suppliers can become more or less powerful. Technological or managerial innovations can make new entry or substitution more or less likely. Changes in regulation can change the intensity of rivalry, or affect barriers to entry. Choices by competition, such as new pricing or distribution approaches, can also affect the path of industry competition. Five Forces analysis is essential to anticipate and exploit industry structural change.

WishList Member [MM_Member_Data name=”membershipName”] Home Page Threat of Substitute Products Business / By Gennaro Cuofano / March 25, 2024 The threat of substitute products is one of the key components of Michael Porter’s Five Forces Framework, which is used to analyze the competitive forces within an industry. It assesses the risk posed by products or services outside of a particular industry that can satisfy similar customer needs or desires. When substitutes are readily available and attractive to customers, they can erode market share and profitability for existing businesses. The level of threat from substitute products varies across industries and markets, influenced by factors such as the availability of substitutes, their quality, pricing, and consumer preferences. Recognizing the determinants of this threat is crucial for businesses to make informed strategic decisions and navigate competitive challenges effectively. Table of Contents Toggle Determinants of the Threat of Substitute Products Strategies to Address the Threat of Substitute Products Real-World Examples of the Threat of Substitute Products Conclusion Key Highlights: Alternative Frameworks Other frameworks by Michael Porter Porter’s Five Forces Porter’s Generic Strategies Porter’s Value Chain Model Porter’s Diamond Model Porter’s Four Corners Analysis Six Forces Models Connected Strategy Frameworks Determinants of the Threat of Substitute Products Several key determinants contribute to the strength of the threat of substitute products in a market. These determinants, while not exhaustive, offer insights into the dynamics of competition and the potential for substitution: Availability of Substitutes: The existence and accessibility of substitute products or services significantly impact the threat level. If close alternatives are readily available, customers are more likely to consider switching. Quality of Substitutes: The quality, performance, and features of substitute products influence their attractiveness to customers. High-quality substitutes can pose a more significant threat. Price Competitiveness: The relative pricing of substitute products compared to the products in the target market affects substitution decisions. Lower-priced substitutes can lure customers away from existing offerings. Consumer Preferences: Consumer preferences and habits play a critical role. If customers have a strong preference for certain substitute products or services, the threat is higher. Switching Costs: The costs and inconveniences associated with switching from one product or service to another influence the likelihood of substitution. High switching costs can deter customers from switching. Product Differentiation: The extent to which products in the target market are differentiated can impact the threat level. Highly unique or specialized products may face a lower threat from substitutes. Regulatory Environment: Government regulations and standards can either facilitate or hinder the emergence and adoption of substitute products. Technological Advancements: Technological advancements can lead to the development of innovative substitutes. Industries susceptible to rapid technological changes may face a higher threat. Brand Loyalty: The strength of brand loyalty can either mitigate or exacerbate the threat of substitutes. Strong brand loyalty can make customers resistant to switching. Complementary Goods: The availability of complementary goods or services can affect the desirability of substitutes. Substitutes that work well with other products may be more appealing. Strategies to Address the Threat of Substitute Products Businesses can employ various strategies to address and mitigate the threat of substitute products: Product Differentiation: Invest in product or service differentiation to make offerings unique and less susceptible to substitution.

It is rooted in industrial organization economics and identifies five forces that determine the competitive intensity and, consequently, the attractiveness or unattractiveness of an industry with respect to its profitability. An \"unattractive\" industry is one in which these forces collectively limit the potential for above-normal profits. The most unattractive industry structure would approach that of pure competition , in which available profits for all firms are reduced to normal profit levels.\nThe five-forces perspective is associated with its originator, Michael E. Porter of Harvard Business School . This framework was first published in Harvard Business Review in 1979. [ 1 ] Porter refers to these forces as the microenvironment , to contrast it with the more general term macroenvironment . They consist of those forces close to a company that affects its ability to serve its customers and make a profit . A change in any of the forces normally requires a business unit to re-assess the marketplace given the overall change in industry information . The overall industry attractiveness does not imply that every firm in the industry will return the same profitability. Firms are able to apply their core competencies , business model or network to achieve a profit above the industry average. A clear example of this is the airline industry . As an industry, profitability is low because the industry's underlying structure of high fixed costs and low variable costs afford enormous latitude in the price of airline travel. Airlines tend to compete on cost, and that drives down the profitability of individual carriers as well as the industry itself because it simplifies the decision by a customer to buy or not buy a ticket. This underscores the need for businesses to continuously evaluate their competitive landscape and adapt strategies in response to changes in industry dynamics, exemplified by the airline industry's struggle with profitability despite varying approaches to differentiation. [ 2 ] A few carriers – such as Richard Branson 's Virgin Atlantic – have tried, with limited success, to use sources of differentiation in order to increase profitability. [ 3 ] Porter's Five Forces include three sources of \"horizontal competition\"—the threat of substitute products or services, the threat posed by established industry rivals, and the threat of new entrants—and two sources of \"vertical competition\"— the bargaining power of suppliers and the bargaining power of buyers. Porter developed his Five Forces Framework in response to the then-prevalent SWOT analysis , which he criticized for its lack of analytical rigor and its ad hoc application. [ 4 ] The Five Forces model is grounded in the structure–conduct–performance paradigm of industrial organization economics. Other strategic tools developed by Porter include the value chain framework and the concept of generic competitive strategies .

This in turn puts pressure on prices, costs, and the rate of investment needed to sustain a business within the industry. The threat of new entrants is particularly intense if they are diversifying from another market as they can leverage existing expertise, cash flow, and brand identity which puts a strain on existing companies \nprofitability. Barriers to entry restrict the threat of new entrants. If the barriers are high, the threat of new entrants is reduced, and conversely, if the barriers are low, the risk of new companies venturing into a given market is high. Barriers to entry are advantages that existing, established companies have over new entrants. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Michael E. Porter differentiates two factors that can have an effect on how much of a threat new entrants may pose: [ 8 ] Barriers to entry The most attractive segment is one in which entry barriers are high and exit barriers are low. It is worth noting, however, that high barriers to entry almost always make exit more difficult. Michael E. Porter lists seven major sources of entry barriers: Supply-side economies of scale – spreading the fixed costs over a larger volume of units thus reducing the cost per unit. This can discourage a new entrant because they either have to start trading at a smaller volume of units and accept a price disadvantage over larger companies, or risk coming into the market on a large scale in an attempt to displace the existing market leader. Demand-side benefits of scale – this occurs when a buyer's willingness to purchase a particular product or service increases with other people's willingness to purchase it. Also known as the network effect, people tend to value being in a 'network' with a larger number of people who use the same company. Customer switching costs – These are well illustrated by structural market characteristics such as supply chain integration but also can be created by firms. Airline frequent flyer programs are an example. Capital requirements – clearly the Internet has influenced this factor dramatically. Websites and apps can be launched cheaply and easily as o",

How to present the results of the Five Forces exercise How have the Five Forces evolved? What are Porter's Five Forces Porter's Five Forces, devised by Michael E. Porter in the 1970s, offers a systematic approach to assessing competitive dynamics within an industry. The framework, named after its namesake, addresses the following factors that are at play in almost every industry: The bargaining power of suppliers. The bargaining power of buyers. The threat of new entrants. The threat of substitutes. The intensity of competitive rivalry. The framework helps organizations understand an industry's competitive landscape, identify key players and their relative strengths and weaknesses, and assess their attractiveness. By analyzing the five forces, organizations can gain insights into the potential risks and opportunities in the market and make informed strategic decisions. An overview of the Five Forces Let's explore each of the Five Forces in detail: 1. Threat of new entrants We start with the threat of new entrants, which evaluates the ease or difficulty of new competitors entering a market. T he threat is typically higher when barriers to entry are low, such as when there are few regulatory restrictions or when capital requirements are low. Issues to consider as barriers : Barriers to entry These encompass capital requirements, economies of scale, and government regulations. For instance, substantial capital needs can deter newcomers. Incumbent advantages While assessing barriers, consider the advantages of established players, like brand recognition, economies of scale, or proprietary technologies. These strengths can bolster entry barriers. 2. Bargaining power of suppliers As you turn to your suppliers' power, it's important to note that this involves more than supplier concentration and switching costs. Suppliers have higher bargaining power when there are few suppliers in the market when the inputs are critical to the buyer's business, and when switching costs are high: Supplier concentration It's about the number of suppliers and their control over critical resources. A single dominant supplier can wield considerable influence. Supplier switching costs Assess the costs and complexities of switching suppliers, as it offers insights into supplier power dynamics. Uniqueness of resources Understand what makes certain suppliers unique to gauge their influence on industry players. Suppliers with exclusive or rare resources often possess greater bargaining power. 3. Bargaining power of buyers The bargaining power of buyers is a significant factor to address. Buyers have higher bargaining power when they purchase in large volumes when the product or service is not differentiated, and when they have access to alternative suppliers: Buyer volume It's not merely about the number of buyers but the volume of their purchases. Product standardization Investigate product standardization to reveal whether buyers have multiple choices or are locked into specific products. In standardized markets, buyers often have more bargaining power. Information availability Access to information about products, prices, and market conditions can impact buyer power. In the digital age, information is a potent tool for buyers. 4. Threat of substitutes Analyzing the threat of substitutes involves understanding not only the existence of substitutes but also the forces driving their adoption: Substitute availability Assessing how readily available substitutes are is vital. The threat of substitutes is similar to the threat of new entrants but refers to the availability of alternative products or services that could satisfy the same customer needs. Factors driving substitution Explore what motivates customers to switch to substitutes. These factors could include price, convenience, or evolving consumer preferences. 5. Intensity of competitive rivalry The intensity of competitive rivalry is the pulse of an industry. Competitive rivalry is higher when there are many competitors in the market when the market is growing slowly, and when there is little differentiation between products or services. This includes examining : Market concentration Consider the concentration of market players. Highly concentrated markets often result in fierce competition as a few dominant firms vie for supremacy. I ndustry growth The pace of industry growth significantly impacts rivalry. Slow-growing industries intensify competition as firms fight for a limited pie. Product differentiation The degree of product differentiation can moderate rivalry. Companies offering unique or highly differentiated products tend to face less intense competition. Understanding and analyzing these five forces can help organizations make strategic decisions, such as entering a new market, launching a new product, or choosing a pricing strategy. The framework is widely used in business and management to evaluate the competitive landscape of an industry and works across any industry and market. How to co",

It looks at five different factors that affect the flow of pricing and power within an industry.: Buyer power Supplier power Competitive rivalry The threat of substitution. The threat of new entry Why Use Porter’s Five Forces Analysis? As different factors change, so does the market that you’re working in. Buyer power waxes and wanes with shifts in the economy. Supplier power changes depending on the availability of their product and the presence of alternative products and suppliers. New competitors appear. Different products appear that might be a substitute for yours. Your existing competitors gain or lose ground against each other and you. Market changes can easily take a company by surprise. Also, If you look back over history, you’ll see numerous examples. It abounds with once-leading global corporations that failed to move with the times and ended up in receivership or severely weakened. That’s why you run analyses using this framework: to keep track of the market, how it’s changing, and your position within it. History of Porter’s Five Forces Michael E. Porter introduced the business analysis framework known as Porter’s Five Forces in his 1979 book, “Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors.” As a Harvard Business School professor, Porter devised this model to assist businesses in evaluating the competitive forces within their industry and formulating effective strategies to achieve a competitive advantage Porter’s Five Forces Explained Buyer Power Customers have power in the marketplace. If no one buys a product, it will fail; In other words, When the number of buyers is relatively low compared to the number of suppliers in an industry, it results in what is referred to as “buyer power,” which is a key aspect of the Five Forces framework. Buyer power, reflecting customers’ ability to influence prices, is influenced by factors such as the quantity and significance of buyers, as well as the costs associated with acquiring new customers or entering new markets for a company’s output. So you need to meet customer requirements before you can successfully sell it. Consumers express this power by: Refusing to buy a product. Choosing a different supplier or brand of product. Returning a product that doesn’t meet their expectations. Example In the mobile network industry, buyer power emerges when a few major providers serve a large consumer base. This gives consumers influence to demand competitive prices and superior services. The ease of switching providers (number porting) amplifies this power, compelling mobile network companies to prioritize consumer preferences for sustained competitiveness. What can a customer actually achieve with this power, though? Well, they can typically push for: Better quality of the product. Lower prices. Improved customer service or support. However, there are other forces at play. These affect how much pressure buyers can exert. For example: How many similar products are available? If buyers have a lot of choices, you need to offer more. The ratio of sellers to buyers. If many suppliers are competing for a few buyers, the buyers can essentially set their own terms. How much it cost to switch sellers? The more difficult and expensive it is to switch, the fewer sellers need to worry about losing customers. The amount and frequency of purchases. Also, If a buyer spends a lot, often, they’re a more valuable customer. Supplier Power Suppliers might be on the opposite side of the supply chain from buyers, but they also have the power to affect the marketplace. If suppliers are the sole source for a specific service, they will have significant supplier power. Assessing the cost implications of switching providers is crucial, even if alternatives exist. A company’s dependence on a supplier intensifies when there are fewer options available in the industry. Suppliers can express power by: Changing the prices at which they sell products. Modifying the level of quality in their products. Increasing or decreasing product availability. Example In the realm of military IT, supplier power is exemplified when a few specialized companies provide crucial technologies for national defense. If a particular supplier is the sole source of vital cybersecurity systems, they hold significant influence. Despite the potential to explore alternatives, the military must carefully weigh the complexities and costs of transitioning such sensitive technologies, highlighting the substantial supplier power in the defense sector. The forces that affect a supplier’s power are similar to those for buyers, only in reverse. This is because the company-supplier relationship is in many ways the reverse of the company-buyer relationship. So the factors affecting supplier power include: How many similar products are available? Does the supplier offer a unique or rare raw material? If they do, and you need that material, supplier power is high. On the other hand, if you have a lot of choices , then supplier power is lower. The ratio of suppliers to companies like yours. Are there numerous suppliers servicing your industry? If many suppliers are competing for sales from a few companies, then supplier power is decreased. How much it costs to switch suppliers? If it will be difficult and expensive for you to change, then supplier power is increased. If it will be simple and cheap, then supplier power is lowered. The amount and frequency of your purchases. If you buy a lot and often, supplier power is lower because you’re a more valuable customer. Competitive Rivalry Competitive rivalry is one of the important Porter’s Five Forces. Examining the level of competition among existing firms in the industry. It reveals that the larger the number of competitors, along with the quantity of equivalent products and services they offer, the lower the power of a company. In industries characterized by intense rivalry, companies attract customers through aggressive price-cutting and high-impact marketing campaigns. High competition frequently results in price wars and diminished profitability. Competitors can express power by: Introducing innovative products or services Implementing effective marketing campaigns Optimizing operational efficiency Enhancing customer experiences Strategically adjusting pricing structures Example In the smartphone industry, competitive rivalry is evident among major players like Apple, Samsung, Motorola, and Huawei. Intense competition drives constant innovation, aggressive marketing, and price wars to capture market share. Companies strive to differentiate through cutting-edge features, compelling designs, and staying responsive to evolving consumer preferences, highlighting the dynamic nature of competitive rivalry in this sector. The threat of substitution This concept pertains to the ease with which customers can switch to alternatives instead of your product. It becomes relevant when customers can either function adequately without your product or perform the service you offer independently. The buyer is at the tail end – essentially this is the power to drive down prices. The existence of substitute goods or services poses a threat. You’ll eventually find yourself with a cap on potential profits. The com",
