Through purchasing strategies, the buyer, unilaterally or through coordination with other buyers, can decrease the purchasing price of its input below the supplier’s standard selling price, above or below the competitive level. Two sub-types of buyer power are distinguished: first, monopsony power, which implies a withholding effect, being inefficient and dubbed the reverse of monopoly power; and second, bargaining (or countervailing) power, in which tactics other than withholding may be used to the benefit of the buyer to reduce the input’s price. Bargaining power tends to be welfare enhancing as supra-competitive profits kept by the supplier are passed on to the buyer and eventually to the end consumers if there is competition in the retailing market. Commentary Introduction – Buyer power is an often-neglected topic in the theory and practice of competition law. Buyer power is economically and legally complex. This is due to its dual nature as either a usually efficiency-enhancing purchasing behavior (bargaining power) or as an inefficient one (monopsony). Buyer power interacts and affects two markets. First and foremost, the upstream market, where the purchases are made; secondly, the retailing market in which the buyer acts as a retailer. Anticompetitive concerns prompted by buyer power have arisen across the whole spectrum of competition law: including agreements, abuse of market power, and concentration cases. Monopsony power describes the situation in which the supply side of a market is perfectly competitive, represented by an upward-sloping supply curve, and in which a sole buyer is present. The buyer will exercise its market power by withholding purchases (i.e., buying less) to decrease the purchasing price it pays for a good/service below the level that would emerge in a competitive market. The price is set by the buyer fixing a purchasing price it is willing to pay for the input, in a take-it or leave-it offer, or by refusing to negotiate on price. In such a setting, the monopsonist becomes a price-maker. This approach to buyer (monopsony) power is essentially the reverse or mirror image of monopoly power. Monopsony is only possible when the buyer faces an upward-sloping supply curve, i.e., the more you buy, the more expensive the marginal unit becomes. Monopsony power exertion also implies suppliers selling below their marginal costs; if this is the case, the suppliers will be eventually driven out of the market. Monopsony cases tend to be rare. Buyers often try to exercise their purchasing power not through a reduction in purchases but by obtaining more favorable conditions However, a few demand withholding examples are found in the case law. Among them, the alleged imposition of abnormally low purchasing prices of film licenses by a dominant buyer ( CICCE v Commission ), agreements between buyers limiting the amount of durum wheat that macaroni producers would include in the formula ( National Macaroni Manufacturers Association v. Federal Trade Commission ) or fixing minimum purchasing prices for grapes for cognac ( BNIC v Clair ). Bargaining power , often labeled as the ‘new’ approach to buyer power, describes the strength in bilateral negotiations of a buyer regarding its supplier(s). Bargaining power allows the buyer to obtain a concession (be it in the form of price and/or non-price terms) from the supplier by, for example, threatening to acquire goods from a different party or simply having the upper hand in the negotiation. Unlike monopsony power, bargaining power does not involve withholding demand or acquiring goods below the competitive price. Instead, it increases trade and neutralizes seller market power by transferring supra-competitive profits from the supplier to the seller that may be passed on eventually to the end consumers. This is because bargaining power can only be exercised where the price is above the supplier’s marginal cost. Therefore, bargaining power tends to be welfare enhancing, being this a reason why there are few anticompetitive cases involving this form of purchasing. That said, bargaining power may raise anticompetitive concerns; these are usually linked to exclusionary effects. Leverage of buyer power to obtain advantages in a subsequent downstream market through the offer of particularly beneficial (and loyalty enhancing) purchasing conditions was discussed extensively in British Airways v Commission through the grant of some ‘reverse’ rebates. Additionally, predatory buying has also been reviewed in the case law and found to be a plausible theory of harm, for instance, by the US Supreme Court in Weyerhaeuser Company, v Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Company, Inc. Bargaining power is often used as a procompetitive argument to justify a conduct and render it compatible with competition rules. Prime examples of this situation are buying alliances that pool buyer power, leading to lower input prices and higher output, as discussed, for instance, in Gøttrup-Klim and Others Grovvareforeninger v Dansk Landbrugs Grovvareselskab, or Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery Printing Co. Countervailing buyer power, or the ability to sufficiently neutralize opposing market power based on the buyer’s bargaining strength in a commercial relationship, has been a topic of discussion in concentration and abuse of dominance cases. While often invoked, practice shows that meeting the sufficiency requirements for countervailing buyer power to effectively prevent seller market power exertion is rare. This neutralizing power must benefit not only the large buyer exerting it but also spill over to other (smaller) buyers, as discussed in Enso/Stora . The type of harm required for EU competition law to be applicable to buyer power cases has also been analyzed by the case law. European courts have found that buyer power liability arises without requiring direct evidence of end consumer harm (e.g.: British Airways v Commission , as well as the spill-over effect requirement in countervailing buyer power cases, such as SCA/Metsä Tissue ). This means that harm that can be proven and has taken place in the upstream market in and by itself is sufficient for competition law to apply; not that this necessarily implies that inefficient suppliers are protected, or that end consumer harm is irrelevant. A narrower approach that focuses on the effects on the output market and, therefore, also direct end consumer harm appears to be adopted in the USA in Weyerhaeuser Company, v Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Company, Inc . This narrower approach assumes that buyers always compete in the same upstream and downstream markets, which is not necessarily the case. The EU Competition law’s scope of application has been defined regarding which purchases are controlled by it and, therefore, determining which exercises of buyer power (or by whom) could be illegal. Not all purchases by an entity imply an economic activity, a defining factor for EU competition law to be applicable. In FENIN v Commission , the ECJ stressed that establishing whether purchasing constitutes an economic activity “must be determined according to whether or not the subsequent use of the purchased goods amounts to an economic activity”. The topics of unfair purchasing practices, gatekeeping and economic dependence have recently brought rare attention to buyer power.

Defined as the ability of buyers to influence pricing, demand concessions, and dictate terms, buyer power is a critical force in Michael Porter’s Five Forces framework. Companies that master buyer power don’t just negotiate better deals; they reshape industries, dictate terms, and protect their bottom lines. So, how can your business leverage buyer power in negotiations? Let’s break it down. What is Buyer Power? Buyer power, one of Porter’s Five Forces, refers to the ability of customers (buyers) to drive prices down, demand better quality or service, and influence terms of trade. The stronger the buyer power, the harder it is for suppliers to maintain high-profit margins. Key Factors That Influence Buyer Power: ✔ Number of Buyers vs. Sellers – Fewer buyers mean greater negotiating leverage. ✔ Purchase Volume – Large-volume buyers get better pricing and terms. ✔ Switching Costs – If buyers can easily switch suppliers, they hold more power. ✔ Product Differentiation – If suppliers offer unique products, buyer power decreases. ✔ Information Access – Buyers who understand market pricing and supplier costs hold an advantage. 📌 Example: Walmart vs. Suppliers Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, exerts tremendous buyer power. Because of its massive purchasing volume and ability to source globally, it forces suppliers to accept razor-thin margins. Suppliers who don’t comply risk losing access to Walmart’s shelves—a devastating blow for many brands. 🔄 Buyer Power in Action: How It Shapes Industries 1️⃣ The Retail Industry: Big Buyers, Small Margins Large retailers like Amazon, Costco, and Walmart dominate their suppliers by: 📌 Negotiating volume discounts – Suppliers must cut prices to secure large orders. 📌 Demanding exclusivity – Retailers pressure brands to create exclusive product lines at lower prices. 📌 Controlling shelf space – Retailers dictate which products get visibility, forcing suppliers to comply with strict terms. 📌 Case Study: Amazon vs. Book Publishers Amazon’s dominance in book retailing forced publishers into hard negotiations. In 2014, Amazon delayed shipments and de-prioritized books from Hachette in a pricing dispute, leveraging its buyer power to extract better terms. 2️⃣ The Automotive Industry: OEMs vs. Suppliers Automobile manufacturers (OEMs) like Ford, Toyota, and Tesla wield massive buyer power over component suppliers. ✔ They purchase in bulk, getting economies of scale. ✔ They can easily switch suppliers, reducing supplier leverage. ✔ They demand cost reductions year-over-year to maintain competitiveness. 📌 Example: Tesla’s Supply Chain Strategy Tesla vertically integrated to reduce supplier dependence, limiting their power. By manufacturing their own batteries (Gigafactories) and controlling more of the supply chain, Tesla flipped the power dynamic in its favor. 3️⃣ B2B Tech & SaaS: Enterprise Buyers Hold the Cards In software and cloud computing, large enterprises hold significant buyer power when purchasing IT solutions. ✔ Customization Demands: Enterprises force SaaS providers to build custom features before signing contracts. ✔ Bulk Licensing: Large firms negotiate aggressive discounts on software licenses. ✔ Data Portability: The ability to easily switch between vendors (low switching costs) increases buyer power. 📌 Example: Microsoft vs. Enterprise Buyers Large corporations negotiate bulk licensing discounts with Microsoft, often paying a fraction of retail prices for Office 365, Azure, and other services. 🔥 How to Leverage Buyer Power in Negotiations Now that we’ve seen buyer power in action, let’s explore how businesses can maximize their leverage in negotiations. 1️⃣ Consolidate Purchases for Bulk Discounts The larger the order, the more negotiating power you have. Businesses can increase order sizes across multiple locations to gain better terms. ✔ Example: McDonald’s centralizes food procurement to negotiate better pricing from suppliers worldwide. 2️⃣ Play Suppliers Against Each Other Buyers should create a competitive bidding environment to extract better pricing. ✔ Example: Airlines pit aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus against each other to secure the best pricing on new planes. 3️⃣ Reduce Supplier Dependence If you rely too heavily on one supplier, they control the power dynamic. Instead, diversify your supplier base. ✔ Example: Apple sources chips from multiple manufacturers (TSMC, Samsung) to reduce dependence on any single provider. 4️⃣ Demand Transparency & Cost Breakdown Buyers who understand supplier cost structures gain an advantage. Companies should require open-book pricing to eliminate hidden markups. ✔ Example: Large construction firms demand detailed cost breakdowns from contractors before approving budgets. 5️⃣ Leverage Long-Term Contracts Suppliers are more likely to offer favorable pricing and terms if they’re guaranteed long-term business. ✔ Example: Airlines negotiate multi-year fuel contracts to lock in lower prices and hedge against volatility. 📉 When Buyer Power Backfires: Risks & Challenges While strong buyer power benefits short-term profitability, it can create risks: 🚨 Supplier Retaliation: If buyers squeeze margins too much, suppliers may retaliate by cutting quality or exiting the relationship. 🚨 Over-Reliance on Few Suppliers: If suppliers consolidate (via mergers), buyer power erodes. 🚨 Ethical Concerns: Excessive buyer power can lead to unfair labor practices in global supply chains (e.g., garment industry). 📌 Case Study: Boeing & the 737 MAX Crisis Boeing aggressively pushed suppliers to cut costs, which some analysts argue led to safety oversights in the 737 MAX aircraft—resulting in fatal crashes and massive financial losses. 🏆 The Bottom Line: Buyer Power is a Game-Changer ✔ Strong buyer power leads to lower costs, better terms, and greater profitability. ✔ Buyers must strategically consolidate purchasing, diversify suppliers, and demand transparency. ✔ Overusing buyer power can backfire—maintaining supplier relationships is key. In negotiations, the real question isn’t what you’re buying—it’s how much power you hold.

It looks at five different factors that affect the flow of pricing and power within an industry.: Buyer power Supplier power Competitive rivalry The threat of substitution. The threat of new entry Why Use Porter’s Five Forces Analysis? As different factors change, so does the market that you’re working in. Buyer power waxes and wanes with shifts in the economy. Supplier power changes depending on the availability of their product and the presence of alternative products and suppliers. New competitors appear. Different products appear that might be a substitute for yours. Your existing competitors gain or lose ground against each other and you. Market changes can easily take a company by surprise. Also, If you look back over history, you’ll see numerous examples. It abounds with once-leading global corporations that failed to move with the times and ended up in receivership or severely weakened. That’s why you run analyses using this framework: to keep track of the market, how it’s changing, and your position within it. History of Porter’s Five Forces Michael E. Porter introduced the business analysis framework known as Porter’s Five Forces in his 1979 book, “Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors.” As a Harvard Business School professor, Porter devised this model to assist businesses in evaluating the competitive forces within their industry and formulating effective strategies to achieve a competitive advantage Porter’s Five Forces Explained Buyer Power Customers have power in the marketplace. If no one buys a product, it will fail; In other words, When the number of buyers is relatively low compared to the number of suppliers in an industry, it results in what is referred to as “buyer power,” which is a key aspect of the Five Forces framework. Buyer power, reflecting customers’ ability to influence prices, is influenced by factors such as the quantity and significance of buyers, as well as the costs associated with acquiring new customers or entering new markets for a company’s output. So you need to meet customer requirements before you can successfully sell it. Consumers express this power by: Refusing to buy a product. Choosing a different supplier or brand of product. Returning a product that doesn’t meet their expectations. Example In the mobile network industry, buyer power emerges when a few major providers serve a large consumer base. This gives consumers influence to demand competitive prices and superior services. The ease of switching providers (number porting) amplifies this power, compelling mobile network companies to prioritize consumer preferences for sustained competitiveness. What can a customer actually achieve with this power, though? Well, they can typically push for: Better quality of the product. Lower prices. Improved customer service or support. However, there are other forces at play. These affect how much pressure buyers can exert. For example: How many similar products are available? If buyers have a lot of choices, you need to offer more. The ratio of sellers to buyers. If many suppliers are competing for a few buyers, the buyers can essentially set their own terms. How much it cost to switch sellers? The more difficult and expensive it is to switch, the fewer sellers need to worry about losing customers. The amount and frequency of purchases. Also, If a buyer spends a lot, often, they’re a more valuable customer. Supplier Power Suppliers might be on the opposite side of the supply chain from buyers, but they also have the power to affect the marketplace. If suppliers are the sole source for a specific service, they will have significant supplier power. Assessing the cost implications of switching providers is crucial, even if alternatives exist. A company’s dependence on a supplier intensifies when there are fewer options available in the industry. Suppliers can express power by: Changing the prices at which they sell products. Modifying the level of quality in their products. Increasing or decreasing product availability. Example In the realm of military IT, supplier power is exemplified when a few specialized companies provide crucial technologies for national defense. If a particular supplier is the sole source of vital cybersecurity systems, they hold significant influence. Despite the potential to explore alternatives, the military must carefully weigh the complexities and costs of transitioning such sensitive technologies, highlighting the substantial supplier power in the defense sector. The forces that affect a supplier’s power are similar to those for buyers, only in reverse. This is because the company-supplier relationship is in many ways the reverse of the company-buyer relationship. So the factors affecting supplier power include: How many similar products are available? Does the supplier offer a unique or rare raw material? If they do, and you need that material, supplier power is high. On the other hand, if you have a lot of choices , then supplier power is lower. The ratio of suppliers to companies like yours. Are there numerous suppliers servicing your industry? If many suppliers are competing for sales from a few companies, then supplier power is decreased. How much it costs to switch suppliers? If it will be difficult and expensive for you to change, then supplier power is increased. If it will be simple and cheap, then supplier power is lowered. The amount and frequency of your purchases. If you buy a lot and often, supplier power is lower because you’re a more valuable customer. Competitive Rivalry Competitive rivalry is one of the important Porter’s Five Forces. Examining the level of competition among existing firms in the industry. It reveals that the larger the number of competitors, along with the quantity of equivalent products and services they offer, the lower the power of a company. In industries characterized by intense rivalry, companies attract customers through aggressive price-cutting and high-impact marketing campaigns. High competition frequently results in price wars and diminished profitability. Competitors can express power by: Introducing innovative products or services Implementing effective marketing campaigns Optimizing operational efficiency Enhancing customer experiences Strategically adjusting pricing structures Example In the smartphone industry, competitive rivalry is evident among major players like Apple, Samsung, Motorola, and Huawei. Intense competition drives constant innovation, aggressive marketing, and price wars to capture market share. Companies strive to differentiate through cutting-edge features, compelling designs, and staying responsive to evolving consumer preferences, highlighting the dynamic nature of competitive rivalry in this sector. The threat of substitution This concept pertains to the ease with which customers can switch to alternatives instead of your product. It becomes relevant when customers can either function adequately without your product or perform the service you offer independently. The buyer is at the tail end – essentially this is the power to drive down prices. The existence of substitute goods or services poses a threat. You’ll eventually find yourself with a cap on potential profits. The com",

Table Of Contents What Is Bargaining Power Of Buyers? The Bargaining Power of Buyers is the influence buyers can have while transacting with sellers, suppliers, or vendors. Due to this leverage, buyers can negotiate better prices, delivery terms, quality, and services. Buyers can steer negotiations in markets dominated by buyers in large numbers. Buyer Power is analyzed qualitatively under Porter's Five Forces Model, which studies the competitive forces influencing an industry. Analyzing the bargaining power of buyers can offer useful insights for every stakeholder, including consumers. Businesses can assess their position and ascertain whether they have leverage in price setting by outlining the extent of power buyers hold. It also helps companies recognize market conditions that require them to accommodate changing customer demands. Table of contents What Is Bargaining Power Of Buyers? Bargaining Power of Buyers Explained Examples Factors How To Reduce? Advantages And Disadvantages Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Recommended Articles The bargaining power of buyers refers to buyers’ ability to influence product prices, terms of sale, delivery, quality, and customer service. It forms part of Porter's Five Forces Model, which is used as a method for strategic business planning. The model was introduced and propagated by Michael Porter in 1979. Consumer bargaining power is unmistakable in many markets. This is because customers can apply pressure and bring about crucial changes in prices, product quality, service levels, promotional offers and benefits, etc. Consumer power is high in cases where buyers can collectively make demands and enforce the rules that suit or favor them in a market. Bargaining Power of Buyers Explained The bargaining power of buyers, a key aspect of business strategy and industry analysis, is the buyers’ ability to affect an industry's profitability. It is a component of Porter's Five Forces Model—a method for strategic business planning. Michael E. Porter, a professor at Harvard Business School, created Porter's Five Forces Model in 1979. The bargaining power of buyer definition states that the presence of strong buyers diminishes the profit potential of an industry. Consumers create competition within an industry by driving down costs, negotiating higher quality or more services, and pitting rival businesses against one another. This harms profitability . Buyers, or consumers, are entities that purchase goods and services. Various business segments in a particular industry may be affected by different levels of buyer influence. Assessing them can help understand whether the products and services in a market are standard or niche by considering prices, features, availability, alternatives, etc. In addition, it shows how easy it is for customers to switch to alternatives or find similar products manufactured by competitors and whether they prefer competitor products. Buyer power is a highly noticeable phenomenon, as influential buyers can use their presence to bring prices down or demand more products or services at existing prices. This way, they capture more value at the same price. Buyer or consumer power for particular goods or services reaches its peak when the number of sellers in a market is insignificant compared to the buyers in that market. Similarly, buyer power is high when products are undifferentiated, i.e., when products are easily available. If the cost of switching to a new product is low, buyer power is high. Another aspect that must be considered in today’s times is the availability of products online (via the internet). Since buyers have access to various products and services, in addition to comprehensive information about them, their power or influence over sellers increases disproportionately. Factors Several factors affect buyer power, and they might change based on the market and the business. These factors can strongly impact the profitability and competitiveness of firms. Given below are some important elements that affect buyer power: Buyer number: If a particular industry has limited buyers, they have high purchasing power. Companies operating in such industries must meet customer expectations pertaining to quality, prices, delivery terms, and discounts for customer retention . Availability of alternatives: This enhances the purchasing power of consumers. Buyers can bargain and secure better terms or prices when similar alternatives offering comparable benefits and features are easily available in the market. Switching costs: These costs affect the purchasing power of buyers. When switching costs are low, customers can quickly switch suppliers. On the other hand, high switching costs can reduce buyer power because changing suppliers or vendors becomes more expensive and challenging. This is particularly true for bulk purchases. Backward integration potential: This refers to integrating or merging suppliers to obtain better delivery terms and product quality. It helps customers enjoy high bargaining power over existing suppliers. Examples Here are a few examples that facilitate further discussion about the meaning of the bargaining power of buyers. Example #1 Let's consider a company named ABC Ltd. manufactures ceiling fans. The electrical fittings and appliances market is saturated since numerous sellers operate in these markets. This means customers have high bargaining power as they have several choices. They can compare prices, quality, and services of various sellers and purchase from a dealer who offers the best bargain or deal. To withstand the competition and remain stable in the market, ABC Ltd. is forced to offer the following: highly competitive prices frequent promotional offers heavy discounts, and several combination deals. Example #2 Buyer power has no effect on luxury items , such as designer bags, apparel, jewelry, etc. Since buyers do not have bargaining power in these markets, no price reduction is seen in such markets that sell niche luxury products. Luxury brands can sell their products at high prices without engaging in negotiations (of any form). As these products are difficult to procure, buyers have no influence over sellers or their business strategies. Customers pay a premium for a luxury brand's reputation, the product’s distinctive characteristics, and the prestige associated with displaying such products in the community, among other things. This strengthens a luxury brand's market position and lowers buyers’ bargaining power. How To Reduce? Businesses can employ certain strategies to reduce buyer power. They have been listed below: Brand loyalty reduces the bargaining power of buyers since customers are willing to pay higher prices (for the products they prefer",

When buyer power is high, customers can easily switch to competitors or negotiate lower prices. On the other hand, when buyer power is low, customers have few alternatives or high switching costs. To reduce buyer power, businesses can segment their market and target specific customer groups with tailored offers, build strong relationships with customers and provide excellent service and support, create loyalty programs, discounts, or incentives that reward repeat purchases and referrals, and differentiate their products or services from competitors by adding value, innovation, or branding.

When supplier power is high, suppliers can charge higher prices, reduce quality, or limit supply. Conversely, when supplier power is low, suppliers have many competitors or low bargaining power. To reduce supplier power, you can negotiate long-term contracts or bulk discounts with your suppliers, diversify your sources of supply and have backup options in case of shortages or disruptions, integrate vertically or horizontally with your suppliers or distributors to gain more control over the value chain, or develop your own capabilities or resources to reduce dependence on external suppliers.

SaaS companies have disrupted the software industry in a profound way, changing the traditional license model to subscription-based. This has not only made software more accessible to businesses of all sizes, but it has also changed the buying power of these companies. \n\nWith the rise of SaaS, businesses are now able to switch to new software vendors more easily and at a lower cost. This means that software companies must now focus on providing high-quality products (Product-Led) and excellent customer service to keep their customers, as there is less of a barrier to switching to a competitor. …see more Like 1 Vijay Nagarajan VP @ Broadcom | Products, Marketing & Strategy | AI, Connectivity | Mentor | Turning Signal into Strategy, Stories into Impact Copy link to contribution Report contribution A good example of supplier power is the recent semiconductor shortage.

To cope with competitive rivalry, it is important to conduct a SWOT analysis to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, monitor competitors' actions and reactions, focus on core competencies and competitive advantages, and communicate them clearly to customers. Additionally, seeking strategic alliances or partnerships with other firms to create synergies or access new markets can be beneficial.

When the threat of new entrants is high, it indicates that there are low barriers to entry, high returns, or unexploited niches. Conversely, when the threat of new entrants is low, it suggests that there are high barriers to entry, low returns, or saturated markets. To discourage new entrants, businesses can invest in research and development, patents, trademarks, or licenses to create entry barriers; establish economies of scale or scope by producing large volumes or offering a wide range of products or services; build customer loyalty and brand awareness by creating a strong reputation and image; and lobby for favorable regulations or policies that protect their industry or limit new entrants.

Cancel Add Save 5 Threat of substitutes The threat of substitutes is the potential for customers to switch to alternative products or services that meet the same need. When the threat of substitutes is high, there are many substitutes available, the cost of switching is low, and customer loyalty is low. Conversely, when the threat of substitutes is low, there are few substitutes available, the cost of switching is high, and customer loyalty is high. To counter this threat, businesses can analyze customer needs and preferences to understand what drives their buying decisions, enhance the quality, performance, or functionality of their product or service and offer additional benefits or features, educate customers about the advantages and disadvantages of their product or service compared to substitutes, and create switching costs by offering complementary products or services, bundling, or locking-in contracts.

One way to focus on the most relevant slice of the market is using Buyer Power Ratio to home in on deals that are similarly situated by one aspect of party negotiating leverage. Developed by SRS Acquiom and the M&A Committee of the ABA's Business Law Section, Buyer Power Ratio compares the buyer's market capitalization to the size of the transaction–the purchase price (including escrowed amounts, but not including potential earnouts). #1 As Buyer Power Ratio increases, a larger percentage of 2018/2019 deals include either a \"10b-5\" representation, a \"full disclosure\" representation, or both. #2 As Buyer Power Ratio rises, the materiality standard applicable to the accuracy of seller representations is likelier to be \"in all material aspects\" rather than MAE. #3 When Buyer Power Ratio is high, it is much less likely that recoverable losses will be reduced by tax benefits.

What is it? Power of Buyers Buyers have the power to influence price and the quantity of products sold. Powerful buyers can bargain on volume or switching costs or they can simply find substitute products. Price sensitivity also impacts the buyer/seller relationship. Questions to Ask Can buyers impact the company's bottom line? Who is the buyer? Are there many buyers or few? Are buyers concentrated? What are the demographics of the consumer? Are buyers price sensitive? What is the relationship of price to consumption? What is your product? How does it differentiate itself from others (brand/quality/cost)? Can buyers substitute? Are customers brand loyal? How does your product get to the market? What are the common distribution channels? Can buyers vertically integrate? How to Search for Buyer Power You can search newspapers and trade journals for articles about a company's products or brands. In databases like Business Source and ABI/Inform, be sure to use the All Text field when searching by brand name.

    "raw_content": "Buyer Power Previous Section Table of Contents Next Section 7.8 Buyer Power The bulk of this chapter looked at facets of market power that is possessed and exploited by sellers. However, in markets with a few buyers that individually make a sizeable fraction of total market purchases, buyers can exercise power that will influence the market price and quantity. The most extreme form of buyer power is when there is a single buyer, called a monopsony In a market with a single buyer, the buyer has the power to push the price down to a minimum. . If there is no market power among the sellers, the buyer is in a position to push the price down to the minimum amount needed to induce a seller to produce the last unit. The supply curve for seller designates this price for any given level of quantity. Although the monopsonist could justify purchasing additional units up to the point where the supply curve crosses its demand curve, the monopsonist can usually get a higher value by purchasing a smaller amount at a lower price at another point on the supply curve. Assuming the monopsonist is not able to discriminate in its purchases and buy each unit at the actual marginal cost of the unit, rather buying all units at the marginal cost of the last unit acquired, the monopsonist is aware that when it agrees to pay a slightly higher price to purchase an additional unit, the new price will apply to all units purchased. As such, the marginal cost of increasing its consumption will be higher than the price charged for an additional unit. The monopsonist will maximize its value gained from the purchases (amount paid plus consumer surplus) at the point where the marginal cost of added consumption equals the marginal value of that additional unit, as reflected in its demand curve. This optimal solution is depicted in Figure 7.2 \"Graph Showing the Optimal Quantity and Price for a Monopsonist Relative to the Free Market Equilibrium Price and Quantity\" , with the quantity Q S being the amount it will purchase and price P S being the price it can impose on the sellers. Note, as with the solution with a seller monopoly, the quantity is less than would occur if the market demand curve were the composite of small buyers with no market power. However, the monopsonist price is less than the monopoly price because the monopsonist can force the price down to the supply curve rather than to what a unit is worth on the demand curve. When there are multiple large buyers, there will be increased competition that will generally result in movement along the supply curve toward the point where it crosses the market demand curve. However, unless these buyers are aggressively competitive, they are likely to pay less than under the perfect competition solution by either cooperating with other buyers to keep prices low or taking other actions intended to keep the other buyers out of the market. An example of a monopsonist would be an employer in a small town with a single large business, like a mining company in a mountain community. The sellers in this case are the laborers. If laborers have only one place to sell their labor in the community, the employer possesses significant market power that it can use to drive down wages and even change the nature of the service provided by demanding more tiring or dangerous working conditions. When the industrial revolution created strong economies of scale that supported very large firms with strong employer purchasing power, laborers faced a difficult situation of low pay and poor working conditions. One of the reasons for the rise of the labor unions in the United States was as a way of creating power for the laborers by requiring a single transaction between the employer and all laborers represented by the union.

Buyer Power And Merger Analysis - The Need For Different Metrics Buyer Power and Merger Analysis The Need for Different Metrics Statement of Peter C. Carstensen Young-Bascom Professor of Law University of Wisconsin Law School 975 Bascom Mall Madison, Wisconsin 53706 pccarste@facstaff.wisc.edu Prepared for the Workshop on Merger Enforcement held by the Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission Washington, DC February 17, 2004 It is a honor to be included in these review discussions and a special privilege to be included in a panel with such distinguished scholars. My interest in the problems that buyer power poses for antitrust analysis comes out of my study of the problems farmers and ranchers face in the marketing of their products. Because of the disproportionate allocation of market power in these markets, the producers of agricultural products face a number of problems in achieving fair, open, accessible, efficient and transparent markets. While some of those problems can only be addressed through reform in the structure of the laws that constitute and govern such markets including the Packers and Stockyards Act, the Agricultural Fair Practices Act, the Agricultural Marketing Agreements Act and the Capper-Volstead Act, (1) the structure of buying markets plays a very significant role in both creating incentives for and the opportunity to exploit buyer power. Mergers that increase such power, both in agricultural and non-agricultural markets, present significant threats to both the short run and long run efficiency of those markets in static as well as dynamic terms. While antitrust law lacks robust and fully developed economic criteria for determining the likely competitive harms that come from increased buyer power, (2) we do have some on the ground observations that are highly suggestive of the kinds of issues and concerns that ought to be considered. Moreover, and of great importance, we have a commitment by the Division's leadership under both the past and present administrations to pursue buyer power cases even when there is no explicit consumer harm. This session of this workshop betokens a further commitment to continue to evaluate the potential of such mergers to cause undesirable competitive effects. It is important to identify relevant types of potential competitive effects and the kinds of market characteristics and structural indicia that suggest when such effects are reasonably likely to occur. For these comments, I take these commitments to make it unnecessary in this forum to argue for the basic proposition that buyer power deserves attention from antitrust authorities. Hence, I want to focus on the ways in which buyer power issues are different from those presented in most seller side evaluations. My fundamental objective is to demonstrate that buyer power analysis requires metrics that measure both power and effects grounded in the economic realities of the buying side of the marketplace. The oft repeated declaration that monopsony is the mirror image of monopoly stands in the way of the kind of thoughtful and critical evaluation of such transactions that good public policy requires. Of course, exploitation and exclusion whether of sellers or buyers has a central commonality. Moreover, most of the effects that are prominent on the buying side of the market have analogs on the selling side. The analysis of buyer power requires the same tools and economic sensitivity to the problems of coercion, exploitation and efficiency that guide merger analysis on the seller side. But the metrics by which likely effects should be measured and the more specific typology of likely effects necessarily must reflect the difference between the economic context of buying and selling. Consequently, the specific analysis will be different exactly because buyers have different incentives than sellers, the markets are different, and the barriers to effective competition on the buying side can be qualitatively different. Hence the conventional criteria for judging whether a merger may merit further inquiry will not identify all the transactions that should be investigated. I want to highlight today some of the observations that I have made concerning both the likely adverse effects on competition and the appropriate measures of markets and market power on the buying side of markets. I should also acknowledge as Assistant Attorney General Pate did in October to the Senate Judiciary Committee that more work needs to be done to gain a better understanding of the competitive implications of increased buyer power in various market contexts. These comments, first, identify key considerations in understanding the implications of the buying side impact of mergers and acquisitions. There follows a discussion of how these points relate to elements of merger analysis. Key Points Incentives, Impacts , Efficiency and Markets on the Buying Side Although I am not an economic theorist or modeler, I do observe patterns in the reported cases and empirical and theoretical work of economists who have evaluated the issues associated with buyer power. This body of information suggests the following salient points about buyer power and its anticompetitive exploitation. The following paragraphs provide a brief review of the concerns that I f",

Start for Free Ivan Kitov • 6 Mar 2023 • 4 min read Buyers are the people who pay for a company’s products and services. In fact, consumer behavior is what really drives a firm’s profits. As such, buyers often demand low prices and high quality. Lowering prices may affect revenues while increasing quality could inflate production costs. Basically, the power of buyers determines how you set your prices. Knowing the bargaining power of your customers creates a strong competitive advantage for your organization. Determining Factors When we talk about buyers, you should know that those are not necessarily the end-users! A large toy manufacturer, for example, may have a number of store chains as customers. Broadly speaking, a buyer power analysis includes the following industry-specific determinants: Concentration of buyers deals with the number of customers that purchase goods and services from a producer. As scarce client concentration makes companies highly dependent on their consumers, any transaction makes a big difference for producers. Thus, such buyers exert strong bargaining power. By contrast, a densely populated client base undermines buyer power. Sales Percentage has to do with the size of a client. For example, a buyer that contributes to 50% of a company’s annual revenue is surely more powerful than the ones bringing 1% or less. Undifferentiated products are usually a prerequisite for a high buyer power, where brand loyalty is low. Many firms selling the same thing allows buyers to become more powerful and look for the best deal on the market. In this way, customers can easily switch providers as they like. Switching costs relate to the costs involved in changing providers. High switching costs mostly presuppose low buyer power. Backward integration is another factor to consider. A buyer that starts manufacturing a product or service in-house will no longer need to purchase it from a provider. This is what we call a threat of backward integration. Information accessibility plays a key role in the bargaining power of buyers as well. If customers know too much about a product, its features and production costs, they may ask for lower prices. Price sensitivity touches on the price sentiment of buyers. Sensitive buyers may switch providers because of a price change. If so, producers are then forced to respect clients’ wishes, giving them the upper hand in the bargaining process. Substitutes refer to market alternatives. Customers with many product options to choose from outpower the providers selling them. Strong Bargaining Power of Buyers When you buy a plane ticket, you usually have many airlines to choose from. You usually enter your travel criteria on the internet and look for the best deal. You are not obliged to use a particular airline; in fact, you may try out a new one every time you travel, so no switching costs are involved. Some itineraries even allow for different means of transportation. For the most part, you focus on the price rather than the brand. Nowadays, flying has turned into a commodity product, thus buyers have high bargaining power. Typically, a strong buyer power presupposes that: Buyers are relatively fewer than sellers Switching costs are low Backward integration is attainable Substitutes are available Buyers are very price sensitive Products are not differentiated Buyers acquire the product in bulk Weak Bargaining Power of Buyers Microsoft’s former general managers wrote the following to Bill Gates back in 1997: “ It is this switching cost that has given our customers the patience to stick with Windows through all our mistakes, our buggy drivers, and many other difficulties. ” This is a typical example of weak buyer power. In practice, the bargaining power of buyers is considered low (or weak) when: Buyers are more than sellers Switching costs are high Backward integration is unattainable No substitutes are available Products are differentiated Buyer Bargaining Power: A Practical Look Let’s take a look at the bargaining power of buyers from a more practical perspective. With over 11,000 stores, Walmart stands as one of the biggest international retail stores in the world. It sells hundreds of different brands to its customers, but it is quite a buyer itself, too. In other words, it functions as both – seller and buyer. As a seller, Walmart deals with many buyers on a daily basis. Contrary to popular belief, those customers exert moderate power over the retail giant. That’s because the store’s low prices and convenience are difficult to find anywhere else. As a result, the company does not feel much pressure from customers when it comes to pricing. At the same time, the constant need for specific new brands that are currently not in stock weakens Walmart’s power as a buyer and strengthens the power of its customers. Now, let’s analyze Walmart as a buyer. As such, the store chain purchases products from different suppliers.  For those producers, Walmart is a buyer, one of the main players to supply products or services to. With the large purchasing volumes and broad customer reach, Walmart thus appears to be a buyer of high power. That’s why its suppliers make sure they cater to its needs at all times. They even build their operational centers adjacent to the store locations, simply to meet Walmart’s demands. And if a supplier isn’t able to accommodate its requests, Walmart is confident enough to just switch to a different one. All this makes the department store a remarkably powerful buyer. Of course, companies like Coca Cola are some of the very few that can overpower Walmart, as they are equally strong and can supply the end customers by themselves. The Bottom Line The bargaining power of buyers is extremely important to providers, but it does not tell us the whole story. The bargaining power of suppliers and the threat of new entrants are other key components involved in the model which we recommend reviewing next. To gain a better understanding of a firm’s competitive position, one should conduct a complete Porter’s 5 Forces analysis.

How can it help you develop a business strategy ? The bargaining power of buyers is determined by the people who pay for your product. How strong of an influence they have determines how much you can charge for your products. The more power your buyers have, the less powerful your strategic position. The Five Forces and the Bargaining Power of Buyers Why are some industries consistently more profitable than others? What makes information technology so stereotypically profitable, while airlines are a cutthroat, low-margin grind? The bargaining power of buyers might have something to do with it, and Porter’s five forces buying power can explain some of this phenomenon. When trying to find an answer, it’s tempting to focus on the competition between rivals. But the bigger is picture than this. Rivals aren’t just competing with each other. They’re also engaged in a struggle for profits with all the other players in the ecosystem – like customers, who would always like to pay less and get more, and are eager to substitute a product for a better alternative. Porter’s five forces buyer power can explain how buys influence markets. To see an industry holistically, consider Porter’s famous Five Forces. The Five Forces that matter in any industry are: Buyers Suppliers Substitutes Incumbents New entrants The more powerful the force, the more pressure it will put on decreasing prices or increasing costs, or both. We’ll examine Porter’s five forces buying power, considering scenarios in your advantage as an incumbent. Scenarios in your disadvantage are usually the inverse of advantageous scenarios, so only notable alternatives will be listed. In this case, we’ll be looking at the bargaining power of buyers. Note that every adjacent industry has its own Five Forces, so that their relative disadvantage can be your gain (e.g. a fragmented supplier group is bad for suppliers but good for you). Force 1: Buyers So what is the bargaining power of buyers? How much influence do buyers have over a business’s profits, and it’s strategy? What this is: Customers who pay for your product Channels that influence the purchase decisions of end-users Retailers like Home Depot, Amazon Advisers like doctors, investment managers What it does: Lowers prices, since powerful buyers will demand lower prices or else Increases costs, since powerful buyers demand more value or else Scenarios in your advantage: If you’re large relative to buyers (i.e. buyers are fragmented) Truck maker Paccar appeals directly to individual owner-operators through comfort and customization, rather than brands like Peterbilt that appeal to large corporate buyers (more consolidated). High switching costs to your competitors Risk aversion dissuades buyers from trying new things. Habits get people accustomed to your product. Low switching costs to you Information asymmetry – inability to price compare, measure quality Scenarios in your disadvantage: Price sensitivity by buyers. This is more likely when your industry’s products are: Undifferentiated Expensive relative to the buyer’s other costs Inconsequential to the buyer’s own performance Buyers are consolidated relative to you and competitors The bargaining power of buyers needs to be a central point of your business strategy. You can understand the bargaining power of buyers in the context of the five forces to build your strategy.

Access now Bargaining power of buyers: Porter’s Five Forces Analysis Researching a market? Our free online course Introduction to Market Sizing offers a practical 30-minute primer on market research and calculating market size. The bargaining power of buyers comprises one of Porter’s five forces that determine the intensity of an industry. The other forces include barriers to entry, industry rivalry, the threat of substitutes and the bargaining power of suppliers. The presence of powerful buyers reduces the profit potential in a given industry. Buyers increase competition within an industry by forcing down prices, bargaining for improved quality or more services, and playing competitors against one another. The result of this is diminished industry profitability. How to assess the power of a buyer group The power of an industry’s important buyer groups depends upon: Characteristics related to its market situation The relative importance of its purchases from the industry as compared to its overall business The following conditions indicate that a buyer group is powerful: The buyer group is concentrated or purchases large volumes relative to the seller’s sales Products purchased from the industry represent a significant percentage of the buyer’s costs or purchases Products purchased from the industry are standard or undifferentiated—alternative suppliers are easy to find and competitors are played against each other Few switching costs exist (little penalty for moving to another supplier) Profits earned are low (greater incentive to reduce purchasing costs) Buyers pose a significant threat of backward integration—buyers demand concessions, and may engage in tapered integration (producing some components in-house and purchasing the rest from outside suppliers) The industry’s product is not important to the quality of the buyer’s products or services The buyer has full information (their knowledge of demand, market prices and supplier costs provide them with leverage) How to mitigate a strong bargaining power of buyer Increase switching costs You can create an environment that makes your buyers more reliant on you; if they were to switch over to a different vendor, it may cost them. Apple’s products/services are an excellent example of increasing switching costs. The company has developed what is known as the “Apple Ecosystem” and has created products/services that can be interconnected, synchronized and seamlessly integrated to provide the best user experience possible. Each product/service introduced by the company complements their overall product suite to maintain their customer base. Vertical integration You can lower your buyer’s bargaining power by exploring forward vertical integration opportunities in your business. For example, Nike introduced their retail store as a Direct-to-Consumer sales strategy, allowing them to bypass the licensed retailer, distributor and wholesaler from the supply chain. This gave them immediate access to consumers, project an exclusive brand identity and dictate their terms. Keep in mind that this option is more viable and logical in a business-to-business environment than in a business-to-consumer environment. Offer differentiated value When your buyers have many options and all products are comparable, differentiating yourself will mainly involve pricing of the product. Differentiation can also be done by including value features, performance, efficacy, durability or warranty. This scenario is more relevant in the consumer market. Innovative business models If you have a novel technology, consider licensing it rather than selling it. Customers will have limited access to your technological know-how in this manner and will also look to you for installation and after-sales support. In some ways, this could be a new source of revenue Personalize your customers’ experience It is crucial to personalize your customers’ interactions with the product and engage with them as individuals. The more personalized their use of your product, the more difficult it is for them to move to a different option provided by a competitor. One of the best examples of personalization is Amazon’s product recommendations, as they use AI and Deep Learning techniques to create product suggestions. This gives customers more product information, while also improving their whole shopping experience. Offers, complimentary services and price strategies Lowering product prices, offering discounts on long-term membership and providing free product upgrades are some conventional ways to retain customers. It is critical to understand and assess your buyers’ bargaining power. Bargaining is more than just price negotiation; your customer can bargain on the technical, functional or economic aspects of your product/service. You must identify and mitigate your buyers’ bargaining power, regardless of how good your relationship with them is or whether they use their power.

This sometimes requires an ability to assess and communicate market dynamics in a clear and meaningful way. One classic tool that I use to frame market dynamics is Porter’s Five Forces . If you’ve worked in procurement as long as I have, you’ve most likely come across it many times and might even question if it is still relevant. (Hint: it most certainly is!) Let’s go through practical tips on how to align Porter’s Five Forces to some of the common challenges faced by procurement teams. After we’ve covered some essential definitions we’ll go through how the framework can be applied to strategic sourcing , category management and supplier relationship management. Recap on Porter’s 5 Forces Porter’s Five Forces is a framework for analyzing the competitive landscape of an industry by examining the threat of new entrants, bargaining power of suppliers and buyers, threat of substitutes, and rivalry among existing competitors. First introduced in 1979 by Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter in his Harvard Business Review article “ How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy ,” this framework provides a structured approach to analyzing the competitive forces at play within any industry. Porter’s Five Forces has been taught in universities for decades and is one of the most recognized strategic management frameworks. Here is how you can see these from the perspective of a modern procurement organization. Threat of new entrants This force examines how easily new competitors can enter the market you operate within. A market with high barriers to entry (e.g., high capital investment, strict regulations, strong brand loyalty) is less susceptible to new competitors, potentially giving existing suppliers more power. Conversely, a market with low barriers to entry increases competition, often leading to better prices and more favorable terms for procurement. Bargaining power of suppliers This force examines the influence suppliers have on price and availability. Suppliers hold significant power when there are few alternatives, offer unique products or services, or when switching suppliers is costly. Strong supplier power can impact a buyer’s profitability and flexibility. Bargaining power of buyers This force analyzes the influence you as a buyer have on price and terms. Buyers gain leverage when they purchase large volumes, have multiple sourcing options, or when they account for a large portion of the sales of a supplier. Strong buyer power is usually favorable for procurement. It can help secure favorable pricing and preferential contract terms. Threat of substitute products or services This force considers how easily customers can switch to alternative products or services that fulfill the same need. The threat is high when substitutes are readily available, offer significant price advantages, or when switching costs are low. If the threat of substitutes is high it may be difficult to justify higher prices. Rivalry among existing competitors This central force analyzes the overall intensity of competition within an industry. High rivalry, driven by factors like numerous competitors, slow market growth, or high exit barriers, can result in price competition and the commoditization of different solutions. Porter’s Five Forces in Strategic Sourcing Porter’s Five Forces can give a balanced understanding of market dynamics to help you describe and drive value beyond simple cost reduction. For this reason, it can be applied to different tasks and steps of your strategic sourcing processes . Define your category profile You can use the Five Forces framework to describe competitive market trends in your category profile . When you’re doing this you don’t need to go into great detail. Simply describe the current snapshot “as-is” state of the competitive landscape and what factors procurement organizations need to keep in mind on a high level. Anticipate market disruptions Too often procurement is seen as a function that looks in the rearview mirror. You can use Porter’s Five Forces to build a view of future needs and market trends. Here you can explore emerging technologies, business models, and alternative solutions that could disrupt existing supply chains. This awareness allows you to be ahead of innovations and mitigate the risk of being locked into outdated agreements. Describe supplier dynamics As a procurement leader you sometimes need to be able to step into the shoes of your suppliers. Porter’s Five Forces can be a way to describe the relative position and motivations of key suppliers. In scenarios where supplier power is high, characterized by limited supplier options or unique offerings, procurement should prioritize building strategic partnerships. Conversely, when buyer power is dominant, procurement can leverage its position to negotiate favorable pricing, payment terms, and contractual agreements. If you want to go further in assessing the needs of your suppliers you can consider building an additional supplier preferencing matrix . Build the case for change in strategy Porter’s Five Forces can also help build the case for a shift in sourcing strategy. It gives executives and key stakeholders a clear and easy-to-understand framework to reflect on changing market dynamics. For example, you can use it to show changes in supplier power, the emergence of disruptive new entrants or substitutes, or the impact of intensifying competitive rivalry on pricing. Uses for Five Forces in Category Management You don’t need to limit the use of this framework to strategic sourcing projects. Porter’s Five Forces can also be a framework to inspire aspects of your broader category strategy . (Re-)assess your category taxonomy You can analyze the differences in supplier power, threat of new entrants, and competitive rivalry within specific categories or sub-categories to get a broader perspective on where to focus your time. This could help prioritize resources towards categories with more favorable market dynamics where you can secure better value. Informed supplier relationships You can have open and transparent discussion",
