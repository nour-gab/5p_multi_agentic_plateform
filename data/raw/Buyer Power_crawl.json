This explosive growth has been fueled by a thriving banking industry, widespread digital adoption, evolving consumer demands, and growing support from investors and regulators. Fintechs have significantly disrupted traditional financial services by offering innovative, customer-focused solutions, embracing collaborative business models, and leveraging diverse and adaptable teams. Current state of fintech The fintech landscape is growing fast and changing how we handle money. In 2023, the global fintech market was valued at $294 billion , with projections indicating an increase to $340 billion in 2024. This upward trajectory is expected to continue, with the market reaching an impressive $1,152 billion by 2032 and demonstrating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.5% between 2024 and 2032. More people are using digital payments too. In 2022, 89% of people in the U.S. used some form of digital payment (up from 51% in 2021), and 62% used two or more types. Awareness of fintech services is high, with only 4% of consumers unaware of money transfers and payments. Despite the overall growth trend, recent investment figures suggest a slight cooling in the fintech sector. In the first half of 2024, total capital invested in fintechs worldwide amounted to $15.9 billion , down from $19.5 billion in the latter half of 2023. This paints a picture of a dynamic and rapidly evolving industry that, while facing investment headwinds, continues to transform financial services and consumer behavior. AI in finance Artificial intelligence technology is changing how finance works, and the AI market is growing fast. In 2023, the market for AI in the financial industry was valued at $42.83 billion , and it expanded to $44.08 billion in 2024. This upward trend is expected to continue, with forecasts suggesting the market will surpass $50 billion by 2029, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 2.91%. This reflects the growing adoption of AI in various financial sectors. From corporate finance to personal finance, AI technology is reshaping how financial services are delivered and consumed. Personalized financial advice AI is making financial advice personalized and accessible. Today’s AI-powered systems can analyze each individual’s unique financial situation and goals to provide tailored recommendations. This trend is gaining traction, with 66.4% of Forbes survey respondents feeling very or somewhat comfortable with their financial transactions and interactions becoming more digital and AI-driven. Robo-advisors — AI-driven platforms that manage investments automatically — are at the forefront of this trend. These systems use complex algorithms to create and adjust investment portfolios based on multiple factors such as age, income, risk tolerance, and financial aims. The growing acceptance of AI in finance is evident, as 59% of survey respondents trust services that use AI to invest their money, while only 14% express distrust in these services. Credit scoring and risk assessment AI is increasingly being used in credit scoring and risk assessment, bringing significant changes in how financial institutions evaluate creditworthiness and assess risk. Enhanced data analysis: AI can process vast amounts of data quickly, allowing lenders to consider a wider range of factors beyond traditional credit scores. This includes analyzing spending patterns, income stability, and even social media activity. For instance, Lenddo uses non-traditional social media and smartphone usage data to assess creditworthiness in emerging markets where many people lack traditional credit histories. Better accuracy: Machine learning models can identify subtle patterns and correlations that human analysts might miss, leading to more accurate risk assessments. Personalized offerings: AI can help tailor financial products to individual customers based on their unique risk profiles and needs. A prime example of this is U.S. Bank partnering with Personetics to offer AI-driven personalized insights and advice to customers, including credit-related recommendations. Customer service chatbots Companies in the financial sector are leveraging AI-powered chatbots to improve overall customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Chatbots can provide round-the-clock availability, ensuring customers can access support at any time, day or night. They deliver instant responses to common queries, significantly reducing wait times and enhancing customer satisfaction. On top of that, chatbots can handle a high volume of simultaneous interactions, making them particularly valuable during peak periods. By leveraging customer data, chatbots offer personalized interactions, tailoring responses and recommendations to each individual’s needs and preferences. Moreover, chatbots maintain consistent service quality across all interactions, unlike human agents who may vary in their knowledge and experience. Bank of America’s AI-powered virtual assistant, Erica, exemplifies the growing importance and adoption of chatbots in finance. An October 2022 publication by Bank of America revealed impressive adoption rates for the bank’s AI chatbot. Since its launch, over 32 million customers have used Erica, and Bank of America states that more than 98% of clients get the answers they need. Embedded finance Embedded finance refers to the integration of financial services or tools within non-financial products, platforms, or services. This encompasses a wide range of financial functionalities that are incorporated into everyday products and services, from payments and lending to insurance and investment. At their core, embedded finance solutions allow non-financial companies to offer financial services directly to their customers, creating a more integrated and frictionless user experience. Embedded finance market overview The embedded finance market is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Industry analysts estimate the market to be worth $115.8 billion in 2024 and project it to reach $251.5 billion by 2029, growing at a robust CAGR of 16.8% during the forecast period. Embedded finance gained momentum in the fintech sector during 2019 and 2020 and saw a significant surge in venture capital investments to $4.25 billion in 2021, nearly tripling the amount from the previous year. Looking at the future of the embedded finance market up to 2029, MarketsandMarkets predicts that B2C business models have the potential to register a high growth rate for various reasons. The availability of financial services on B2C platforms brings transactional convenience to consumers by letting them perform financial operations in familiar portals. Embedding payment, lending, and insurance services directly into these platforms makes such services more accessible and enhances engagement. Applications and examples of embedded finance Embedded finance is being applied across a wide range of industries, revolutionizing how financial services are delivered. Let’s look at key types and examples. Embedded payments refers to the integration of payment processing directly into a non-financial platform or app. A good example of this is Uber’s seamless payment system, which allows riders to pay for their trips without exiting the app. Embedded lending is when users of a non-financial platform are provided with an option to get a loan or credit service. For instance, Klarna allows shoppers to buy now, pay later directly at the point of sale on eCommerce websites. Embedded banking is when banking services are integrated into non-banking platforms or apps. That’s how Shopify Balance offers its merchants a business account, card, and financial products directly within the Shopify plat",

Retrospective Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the fintech industry Understanding Customer Experience in Fintech in 2024 Emerging Customer Engagement Trends in Fintech Share FinTech is a growing industry at the intersection of technology and financial services. This is a powerful incentive for technological progress, which expands its influence on different sectors of the economy, allowing them to develop . For example, FinTech has been most active in consumer services, banking, money transfers, payments, insurance, asset and capital management. The industry is revolutionizing the way businesses and consumers conduct financial transactions. According to McKinsey , revenues in the fintech industry will grow almost three times faster compared to the traditional banking sector between 2023 and 2028. First of all, this is caused by the ability of neobanks to disrupt the industry, innovate, and differentiate. Fintech products are focused on solving customer needs and putting customer experience first. Here are the latest customer engagement trends for fintech The FinTech market is expected to grow from $340.10 billion in 2024 to $1152.06 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 16.5%. As AI develops, more fintech companies will use it to automate customer touchpoints, decrease human errors, and increase security. According to the research , 90% of Fintech companies are using AI, and this number will continue to grow. As the industry has matured and the market is saturated with various fintech solutions, customers are more demanding now than before. That’s why it becomes more challenging for fintech businesses to win customers' hearts and differentiate their services from traditional banks. In order to attract new customers and retain existing ones, fintech businesses should invest in building a customer experience in fintech and always improve their customer experience. FinTech in 2021. Retrospective Enhancement of customer experience in banking services In my opinion, nowadays many banks are still in the same position as before when they chose to provide customer service or not and still had a good profit. Gradually they find themselves in a situation where they need to look for a revenue stream and therefore try to maximize the number of their customers, as the margin of their products falls. Today it is not the bank but the client who chooses. The modern client is interested not as much in a good bank rate or the price of banking service, but in the convenience and speed of using the bank, the ability to work with the bank only remotely (especially during the COVID-19 pandemic), the availability of a good mobile application with various services for family, work and study. An important criterion is whether the bank has a high-quality KYC service to recognize the identity of the counterparty. New banking products. Crossing of financial products The S-PRO team is currently developing a product for an American company operating in the African market. And transport paying products are gaining popularity there, for example, special bank cards. The number of such products is growing, as is the competition. This is a trend related to the first trend - customer experience. People need a lighter digital experience, which often involves paying for something. When a person wants to buy a product in instalments online, it’s also a fintech story but it happens at the intersection of eCommerce and fintech. Banks used to hold the whole market, but today they have a lot of competition from startups. Young companies are more flexible, they see customer prospects faster, and they don’t need to do extensive analysis. In addition, there are many young talents who can and want to create something. Banks, in turn, are also interested in this, because they invest in such young companies and then can buy them. Here the issues are in the framework of collaboration with new players - large banks are already able to cooperate with startups. But middle-class banks still need to learn to do the same. Startups are actively becoming distributors of banking services. Of course, banks are still trying to create their own financial products, such as banking products for accountants, for opening a new company, etc. Cryptocurrencies are becoming more popular The third trend is cryptocurrencies, a subsection of trends 1 and 2, I would say. In 2021, this fintech product continued to penetrate the banking sector. And cryptocurrencies appeared precisely because of customer experience. For people who need dynamics, speed and simplicity, such products are more convenient for payments. And in some areas, Bitcoins or Ethereums are best suited for this. There is an increase in the number of companies that conduct their business exclusively through Bitcoins or Ethereums. Cryptocurrencies have good financial turnovers and need strong operating activities and convenient banking services. But at the same time, it’s difficult for them to get legal and to get normal bank accounts. Today there are more and more cryptocurrency startups that work in financial services, payment processing, and software. They work as a wallet service, can securely store cryptocurrency from a range of different attacks, support all cryptocurrencies as well as do a decentralised exchange and provide many different opportunities: Cobo, Javvy, Finhaven, Digital Currency Group, Binance, and others. By the way, among our projects is a digital-bank, which works with large crypto companies, and provides them with various banking services. This is when you can come and put cryptocurrency in the bank. Also, you can get legal financing through a bank, but in cryptocurrency. Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the fintech industry In general, the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the industry depends on how much money banks make from their offline services and how they can operate online. The share of online banks is likely to have increased, while that of offline banks has decreased. Different banks operate in different industries, with their own area of expertise. Some provide B2B services, others have certain products, and others just have a bank for the population. During the first wave of Covid-19, the impact of the pandemic on the banking sector was negative, as turnover, orders and profits fell in many companies. Demand for bank loans decreased, and banks earned less on lending. In this situation, in order to maintain a positive level of profits, banks increase the fee for certain financial activities and services and develop Internet banking, including mobile banking. Citizens are increasingly shopping online and making payments through electronic banking. Among other things, since the beginning of the pandemic, the WHO (World Health Organization) recommends the use of contactless payments. Even before the outbreak of the coronavirus, the demand for digital banking grew due to the lack of time and desire to contact the physical branches of banks. The pandemic has stimulated the development of online banking platforms to make every banking service available online. Understanding Customer Experience in Fintech in 2024 Online financial operations have already become a part of our lives. The number of worldwide mobile banking users is expected to exceed 2 billi",

The way consumers log in to bank accounts, pay for goods, and take out loans are all changing dramatically. Financial institutions are also constantly adapting as they try to predict the needs of consumers, serve their current customers, and prevent fraud. If you want to see what's coming next in this growing industry, check out our list of the 10 most important fintech industry trends for 2024 and 2025. 1. Growing Interest in Embedded Finance Embedded finance is the integration of financial services into non-financial websites and apps. Search volume for “embedded finance” has grown by 682% over the last 5 years. At a high-level, embedded finance service is driven by a desire for convenience. A simple example is an eCommerce site offering buy now, pay later (BNPL) options. Searches for “BNPL” are up 630% over the last 5 years. Instead of needing to visit a bank to get a loan and spend hours on paperwork, consumers can access credit without leaving the platform they’re on. Another example is embedded payments. Consumers don’t need to enter their credit card information every time they wish to make a purchase; the information is already there. The embedded finance market currently sits at $63.2 billion and is predicted to grow to more than $248 billion by 2032. The most popular embedded finance tool right now is making payments via a digital wallet. A recent survey found that 49% of Americans have used a digital wallet. Notably, the study also found that 80% of Gen Z use digital wallets on a regular basis. Statistics show Americans are using embedded finance for payments, loans, credit cards, and investments. Companies that can jump on this trend early stand to see a positive reaction from their customers. A report from Bond, a fintech software infrastructure company, said one-third of consumers who use a brand’s embedded financial services spend more money with the brand and 30% of them now choose that brand over the competitors more often. Bond’s report shows that embedded finance options can lead to increased consumer spending and brand loyalty. Maast (it stands for money-as-a-service) is one fintech company that’s making it simpler for brands to offer banking services under their own brand. Their approach allows brands to run payments, deposits, and loans on the platform. Maast is a subsidiary of Synovus Bank, which recently bought a 60% stake in Qualpay in order to facilitate its payment technology. They report their technology can result in a 5x increase in revenue per customer. 2. Regtech Solutions Provide Accuracy and Efficiency Financial institutions receive enormous amounts of data on a daily basis. The data is far too complex and cumbersome to comb through manually. In addition, companies need to have a thorough understanding of the unprecedented amount of laws and regulations that they must abide by. That’s where regtech (regulation technology) comes into play. Regtech solutions use cloud technology, machine learning, and big data analytics in order to identify and prevent risks, as well as to stay in compliance with regulations. This kind of technology can offer improved efficiency, greater accuracy, and better insights for the entire company. Juniper Research predicts the regtech industry will experience 200% growth through 2026. Financial institutions who invest in regtech solutions hope to see the cost savings come through to the bottom line. More than 30% of financial institutions spend greater than 5% of their revenue on compliance. The cost of regulatory compliance is a challenge for most financial institutions. The global cost of financial crime compliance at financial institutions $85 billion last year. The same industry study also found that compliance costs increased for 98% of the organizations surveyed. A Thomson Reuters survey showed that 67% of G-SIFI organizations expected to require additional senior staff members just to cope with the volumes of regulatory requirements. The cost of maintaining a properly trained compliance staff is increasing. Those companies that fail to ensure proper reporting and compliance face sizable fines. IJP Morgan was forced to pay $125 million for failing to follow correct compliance controls. Australian banks ING and CommBank give us one example of how regtech can dramatically impact compliance efforts. In previous years, these banks were manually mapping their regulatory obligations through a process that took approximately 1,800 hours of human effort . However, when the banks partnered with Ascent , a regulatory knowledge platform that utilizes AI, they reduced the process to 2.5 minutes. Search volume for “Ascent” since mid 2019. 3. Robotic Process Automation Takes Over Mundane Tasks Many financial institutions are turning to robotic process automation (RPA) in an effort to drive down costs and make their teams more efficient. RPA technology is also referred to as “software robotics.” It’s useful for automating repetitive, rule-based, time-consuming tasks that don’t require human brainpower. Grand View Research predicts the RPA market will grow at a CAGR of 38.2% by 2030. Gartner reports that 80% of finance leaders have already implemented RPA solutions in their businesses or have plans to do so. They’re using the technology to provide insights into customer behavior, analyze invoices, route customer complaints, fight financial crime, and much more. In 2024, Gartner predicts CFOs who have driven hyper-automation technology adoption and redesigned operational processes will be saving 30% on their organization’s operational costs. UiPath is one of the most well-respected RPA software companies in the world. The company has a market cap of over $6 billion . RPA firm UiPath is now a public company. In an example of their work, one of the brand’s finance and accounting customers automated 22 processes and saved 80k hours of manual labor as a result. Automation Anywhere is one company offering RPA-as-a-Service. Automation Anywhere’s RPA platform is used by a variety of industries. Patelco , a San Francisco-based credit union, recently used this cloud-native solution to automate a few of their consumer lending, fraud prevention, and contact center operations. The RPA system was instrumental in driving efficiency as Patelco was experiencing 11% year-over-year growth in its member base. Patelco saw an 88% decrease in processing time, a 62% efficiency gain, and $39k yearly savings as a result of automating their fraud alerts. 4. Fintech Companies Offer Finance Solutions Along With Green Initiatives As consumers and corporations start to put more emphasis on environmentally sustainable practices, the fintech industry is capitalizing on the opportunity. Search volume for “green fintech” is climbing, up 276% in the past 5 years. Currently, only 8% of fintech founders say they are in the “sustainable fintech” category. However, investors are flocking to this sector. Green fintech startups and initiatives span the globe, but the highest concentration of these companies is in Switzerland, Spain, Singapore, and Sweden. Trine is a Swedish company that loans solar ",

Banks are facing big challenges from the shift to digital banking and the wave of branch closures around the world. They are becoming more distant from their customers, with the result that 20% of customers don’t think their bank cares about or understands their needs; customer demands are evolving rapidly, with banking customers seeking frictionless banking activities, 24/7 support, and rich, meaningful, actionable and personalized engagement. As open banking adoption grows worldwide, banks compete not only with each other but also with fintech providers and other financial service providers. As this economic turmoil also presents a series of opportunities for banks. Institutions can use this time to deepen their customer loyalty and win themselves a place as a beloved source of trusted advice and automated banking actions. Forward-thinking financial institutions do this by leveraging their biggest asset: their own customer financial transaction data. By developing deep insights into their customers’ financial behaviors, needs, and preferences, the future of digital banking will be bright. By talking to banks and our partners around the world, we spot trends and patterns within the finance industry. We’ve compiled 12 predictions from Jody Bhagat, President of the Americas, and Dorel Blitz, VP of Business Development and Strategy at Personetics, to help you prepare for what this year will bring. 1.  Personalization will become ubiquitous and table stakes 2023 will see the move from basic personalization and traditional PFM capabilities , which delivers little, if any, business impact, to fully commercializing customer engagement for the benefit of both banking customers and banks themselves. Personetics’ research reinforces this notion as banks struggle to raise their customer lifetime value (CLV) and conversion rates for financial products from around 2%. The need to improve this figure is driving banks to finally move forward and monetize their relationship with customers. Banks need to leverage personalization, as they have little else to differentiate them from their competitors. Looking further ahead, Jody forecasts that personalization will lead to the “death of the marketing banner” when banks can deliver personalized product offers embedded in insights and advice that will boost conversion rates. On the other side of the transaction, banking customers want banks to leverage data more effectively and deliver more personalized care and solutions while 44% want their bank to provide them with more personalized and timely financial advice. As a result, Jody predicts that “a basic version of personalized insights will become ubiquitous and table stakes by the end of 2025.” Best practices already center around connected channels, which enhance both human and digital connections to foster meaningful relationships with customers. 2.  Banks will move from traditional PFM to advanced money management capabilities As we enter 2023, banks will move on from the beneficial but limited sphere of personal finance management ( PFM ), into the realm of advanced money management . Recent research by Forrester confirms that in today’s turbulent economic conditions, customers need banks to provide broader money management support that improves their financial well-being, using technology to understand each customer’s financial situation and assist them in stabilizing their finances and boosting their financial health. This involves a technology partner like Personetics that can analyze customer financial data in real-time to deliver meaningful insights and advice. Money management begins with AI-based categorization and enrichment of all transaction information – including Open Banking – so that banking customers can understand their money movements. Truly advanced money management provides accurate cash flow prediction that shows customers how much they can spend and save based on real-time behavior and transaction analysis. This extends to automated savings and debt repayments, personalized financial insights that nudge customers towards better financial health, and management for recurring costs like subscriptions and monthly bills. Ultimately, banks can become trusted financial advisors who provide advanced money management capabilities and automate wearisome banking actions. The impact on their business KPIs will be enormous. As Dorel remarked: “Traditional PFM and money management tools do not increase customer engagement and sales metrics. This is due to the lack of AI-based models and predictive cashflow capabilities to provide accurate analysis. In addition, they lack product-based advice and wellness automation solutions that are connected to the customer’s existing and future financial behavior.” 3.  Connected channels will rule for customer engagement Connected channels are the final step in the journey to customer engagement utopia. Besides delivering more personalized insights and active assistance for daily financial activities, banks will combine tools, products and insights into a unified system that nudges customers into actualizing the good habits they wish to implement. With connected channels, banks will propagate customer intelligence across all their channels, including digital customer portals, human bankers who will reach out t",
