So you want to grow and succeed in the market!? lets dive deep in to Porter's Five Forces. First, let's ask the question: What are Porter's Five Forces? Porter's Five Forces is a powerful analytical framework created by Michael E. Porter in 1979. This model assists businesses in assessing the competitive factors influencing their sectors and determining their strategic orientation. Understanding these influences allows businesses to build ways to increase their competitive edge and profitability. This article examines each of the five forces and discusses their consequences for company strategy. 1. Threat of New Entrants. The threat of new entrants refers to the possibility that new companies will enter the industry, increasing competition. Several reasons contribute to this hazard, including: Barriers to Entry: Significant capital requirements, economies of scale, strong brand identification, and access to distribution channels can all prevent new entrants. Government Policy: Regulations and policies can either impede or facilitate new entrants. Switching Costs: If customers have to pay a significant cost to transfer suppliers or brands, the threat of new entrants is lessened. A high risk of new entrants can put pressure on established businesses to constantly innovate and enhance their products and services in order to retain market dominance. 2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers Suppliers can exert influence over businesses by raising prices, lowering quality, or restricting the supply of goods and services. The bargaining strength of suppliers is affected by: Supplier Concentration: When there are fewer suppliers, they wield more power. Availability of Substitutes: When alternative suppliers or substitute inputs are readily available, supplier power falls. Importance of Volume: Suppliers who rely substantially on a single industry for a large share of their sales may have less bargaining leverage. Strong supplier power can reduce industry profitability by raising costs for businesses. 3. Buyers’ Bargaining Power Buyers' bargaining power refers to their capacity to influence prices and terms. This power is influenced by: Buyer Concentration: A few large buyers can put tremendous pressure on suppliers. Price Sensitivity: Buyers who are price sensitive are more inclined to negotiate lower costs. Switching Costs: Low switching costs boost buyer power since customers can readily switch to competitors. High buyer power can drive down prices and profits, forcing companies to improve their value offerings in order to retain customers. 4. Threat to substitute products or services The threat of replacements develops when multiple items or services can meet the same need or function. Factors that affect this threat include: Substitute Availability: A larger number of substitutes indicates a greater threat. Relative Price and Performance: If replacements provide higher value in terms of both price and performance, the threat increases. Switching Costs: High switching costs can mitigate the threat of substitutes. A strong threat of alternatives can limit a company's price power, necessitating continual product and service innovation and distinction. 5. Competitive Rivalry Competitive rivalry refers to the level of competition between existing enterprises in the industry. This force is affected by: Number of Competitors: More competitors often result in greater rivalry. Industry Growth: Slow growth or decline in an industry can exacerbate competition as firms vie for market share. Product Differentiation: When items are identical, competition grows as companies try to separate themselves. Excess Capacity and Exit Barriers: High fixed costs and challenges in departing the market might exacerbate competitiveness. High competition can reduce profitability and encourage businesses to engage in aggressive marketing, pricing wars, and innovation conflicts. After understanding Porter's Five Forces, you will ask another question, How do you integrate Porter's Five Forces into marketing strategies? After reading about Porter's Five Forces in Simon Kingsnorth's book \"Strategic Marketing,\" it is evident that these forces are critical not just for understanding competitive dynamics but also for formulating marketing strategies. Here's how they can be incorporated into marketing campaigns and research: Market Entry Strategies: By analyzing the threat of new entrants, businesses can develop marketing strategies that highlight unique selling points and foster strong brand loyalty, making it more difficult for new competitors to gain traction. Supplier Relations: Understanding suppliers' negotiating strengths can help steer negotiations and collaborations, resulting in stable supply chains and cost control. Marketing teams can also convey to clients about the supply chain's dependability and quality. Customer Insights and Retention: Understanding buyers' bargaining power aids in personalizing marketing messages to meet their wants, preferences, and price sensitivities. Customer retention can be improved by strategies like loyalty programs and personalized marketing. Product Development and Diversification: Assessing the threat of replacements motivates businesses to develop and diversify their product offerings. Marketing efforts can therefore concentrate on marketing new features, benefits, and distinguishing characteristics of the company's offerings. Competitive Positioning: Analyzing competitive rivalry informs the development of positioning strategies that set a brand apart from its competitors. Marketing initiatives can highlight distinctive characteristics and capabilities in order to capture and keep market share. In the next article, each of the five points of Porter's Five Forces will include examples of significant corporations using them in their strategies.

of FinTech: Six Trends Defining 2025 Read | Jun 17, 2025 Download Article AUTHOR(s) Aarushi Chopra Senior Consultant, Solution, Banking and Financial Services Sourav Dutta Lead Consultant, Solution, Banking and Financial Services Key Points Agentic AI is ushering in a new phase of FinTech innovation in 2025 – enabling autonomous decision-making and re-defining how financial services are delivered. As customer expectations, regulatory landscapes and technology architectures evolve, FinTechs must re-imagine operating models with agility, trust and embedded intelligence. This article examines six defining trends – from glocal payments and crypto integration to embedded finance and cybersecurity – that will shape the FinTech ecosystem in 2025 and beyond. The FinTech revolution has already re-defined the financial landscape, but 2025 will accelerate transformation even further as the industry moves toward a projected USD 1.5 Trillion market by 2030. 1 Emerging technologies – from agentic AI to blockchain and biometrics – are supercharging the race to innovate, while regulatory changes are creating both new pressures and fresh opportunities. To lead in this landscape, FinTechs must focus not just on building smarter tools – but on designing smarter businesses. The winners will be those who blend AI-driven intelligence with contextual decisioning, agile operating models and customer-centric design. Here, we explore six key trends set to define the FinTech space in 2025 and beyond. 1. Payments Re-defined Shifting consumer payment preferences are disrupting one-size-fits-all approaches, with demand growing for diverse, seamless payment options. Future-ready players are embracing 'glocal' payment solutions, which combine global reach with local preferences. According to recent research, local payment methods are expected to account for 58 percent of global eCommerce transactions by 2028, up from 47 percent in 2023. 2 Regional variations are clear – think WeChat Pay and Alipay in China, UPI in India, Pix in Brazil, M-PESA in East Africa or the preference for bank transfers in much of Europe.

Meridian Credit Union  Taking on the Big Banks Porter Five Forces Analysis Posted by Zander Henry on\n                            Aug-22-2018 Porter Five (5) Forces Model Porter Five (5) Forces Model was proposed by Michael E. Porter in 1979. The purpose was to assess and evaluate the competitive positioning and strengths of business organisations. The model has three horizontal competitive forces (Threat of Substitute Products or services, the threat of new entrants and rivalry among existing firms) and two vertical forces (Bargaining power of buyers and bargaining power of suppliers). These forces shape the competition within any industry. The overall industry competitiveness declines when these forces reduce profitability. Porter found SWOT analysis lacking in rigour. Many new companies use the Porter Five (5) Forces Model to decide whether it is profitable to enter in a particular industry. Here is the pictorial presentation of the Porter Five (5) Forces Model: Meridian Credit Union  Taking on the Big Banks Porter Five (5) Forces Analysis Application of this model can help Meridian Credit Union  Taking on the Big Banks to determine the industry attractiveness and understand its competitive positioning in the market. The analysis can also be used to make some strategically wise decisions that could improve the performance of Meridian Credit Union  Taking on the Big Banks and ensure long-term survival. Threats of new entrants Threat of new entrants reflects how new market players impose threats to the existing market players. If the industry will be profitable and barriers to enter the industry will be low, it will attract more players and hence, the threat of new entrants. will be high. Here are some factors that reduce the threat of new entrants for Meridian Credit Union  Taking on the Big Banks: Entry in the industry requires substantial capital and resource investment. This force also loses the strength if product differentiation is high and customers place high importance to the unique experience. Meridian Credit Union  Taking on the Big Banks will face the low threat of new entrants if existing regulatory framework imposes certain challenges to the new firms interested to enter in the market. In this case, new players will be required to fulfil strict, time consuming regulatory requirements, which may discourage some players from entering the market. The threat will be low if psychological switching cost for consumers is high and existing brands have established a loyal customer base. New entrants will be discouraged if access to the distribution channels is restricted. Meridian Credit Union  Taking on the Big Banks will be facing high new entrants threat if Existing regulations support the entry of new players. Consumers can easily switch the brands due to weak/no brand loyalty. Initial capital investment is high. Building a distribution network is easy for new players. Retaliation from the existing market players is not a discouraging factor. How Meridian Credit Union  Taking on the Big Banks can tackle the Threat of New Entrants? Meridian Credit Union  Taking on the Big Banks can develop brand loyalty by working on customer relationship management. It will raise psychological switching costs. It can develop long-term contractual relationships with distributors to widen access to the target market.

Threat of Substitute Products or services The availability of substitute products or services makes the competitive environment challenging for Meridian Credit Union  Taking on the Big Banks and other existing players. High substitute threat shows that customers can use alternative products/services from other industries to meet their needs. Various factors determine the intensity of this threat for Meridian Credit Union  Taking on the Big Banks The Threat of Substitute Products or services increases when; A cheaper substitute product/service is available from another industry The psychological switching costs of moving from industry to substitute products are low. Substitute product offers the same or even superior quality and performance as offered by Meridian Credit Union  Taking on the Big Banks’s product.

Picture this: a digital landscape where autonomous AI agents are out there, transacting in cryptocurrencies and reshaping our economy. This isn't some far-off future; it's what we're heading towards as AI and blockchain technology converge. But like anything, there are pros and cons to consider. The Agentic Web: What Is It? The Agentic Web is a term coined by Coinbase Ventures that describes a future where self-directed AIs create decentralized applications and interact with humansâand each otherâusing crypto. Think about it: traditional banking systems could be turned upside down. With AI handling identity verification, opening accounts could become instantaneous, eliminating those tedious manual checks. And let's not forget how much money banks spend on operational costs. But here's the kicker: while AI might make things smoother for banks, itâs also making them more vulnerable in some ways. Imagine an AI detecting fraud in real-time or automating processes to minimize human error. On one hand, it boosts efficiency; on the other, it raises the stakes if something goes wrong. Skyfire's Vision Recently, I came across Skyfireâa Web3 payments platform that just snagged $9.5 million from some big VC names like Coinbase Ventures and a16z. Their goal? To build infrastructure that allows these autonomous AI agents to transact seamlessly in US Dollar Coin (USDC), a stablecoin that's gaining traction fast. Skyfire has already onboarded several developers onto their network, showcasing how integral AI could be in enhancing payment platforms. But then you think about itâare we ready for a world where payment decisions are made without human intervention? The Blockchain Backbone Blockchain technology is at the heart of these crypto banking platforms. It offers a secure and transparent framework that traditional systems can't matchâor can they? With advanced detection algorithms powered by AI , banks can now identify fraudulent activities faster than ever before. And get thisâAI isnât just streamlining operations; it's revolutionizing them! From loan processing to customer service automation, financial institutions are looking at massive cost savings and efficiencies. But againâthe reliance on tech opens up new vulnerabilities. Venture Capital's Big Bet What really caught my attention was how much venture capital is pouring into this space. According to Messari, VC firms invested around $213 million into AI-related startups just last quarter! Thatâs a lot of faith being placed on the intersection of two technologies that could either liberate us or enslave us. On October 10th, Aethirâa decentralized GPU providerâannounced theyâre launching a $100 million fund specifically aimed at accelerating innovation inâ¦ you guessed itâ¦ artificial intelligence! They want to support the development of platforms that will further integrate AI into our economy. Stablecoins Taking Over? One trend seems clear: stablecoins like USDC are becoming go-to options for transactions due to their reliability amidst market chaos. As we move towards an era dominated by autonomous agents making decisions on our behalf (or maybe against our interests?), having a stable form of currency will be crucial. Coinbase Ventures even predicts that crypto will soon become the preferred payment method for both agent-to-human and agent-to-agent interactions! Generative AI is expected to create most software codeâincluding smart contractsâwhich begs another question: who audits these codes? Summary: Are We Ready? So here we are at the cusp of something monumentalâor potentially catastrophic. The convergence of AI and blockchain promises greater efficiency but also poses unprecedented risks. As we step into 2024 with these technologies looming large over us, one thing is certain: whether we embrace or resist this new reality may very well depend on how informed we choose to be about it.

Predictive analytics, audit-ready compliance reports, and a centralized dashboard enhance operational efficiency, payment management, and decision-making. Learn More TL;DR: This week, I’m diving into some big trends shaping payments, banking, and fintech—so grab your coffee (or chai) and let’s catch up on what’s making waves! First up, Payments as a Service (PaaS) is transforming how businesses manage their finances. From seamless cross-border payments with real-time currency conversion to multichannel payment acceptance and fraud prevention powered by machine learning, PaaS is helping businesses cut costs, streamline processes, and drive growth. Whether it's automating accounts payable or using data to optimize cash flow, the opportunities here are endless for enterprises juggling global operations. In the crypto world, the EU’s MiCA regulation is setting the stage for clearer classification of cryptoassets. Think of it as the safety net regulation for assets falling outside traditional financial frameworks. MiCA’s approach to asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and e-money tokens (EMTs) is worth a closer look, as it could be a model for balancing innovation and oversight in the crypto space. Real-time payments (RTPs) are booming globally, and stories like India’s UPI, Brazil’s Pix, and Thailand’s PromptPay show how infrastructure, consumer demand, and business buy-in create payment revolutions. The rise of RTPs reminds us how quickly new payment methods can reshape economies when the right conditions align. B2B payments are also going digital faster than ever. With projections of $26 trillion in marketplace GMV by 2030, digital-first solutions like ISO 20022 and Swift GPI are making cross-border and domestic transactions faster, cheaper, and more transparent. But challenges persist—just ask corporate treasurers struggling with cash flow forecasting and operational inefficiencies. And let’s talk about AI in banking—whether embedded in tools like Microsoft Copilot, transforming operations like call centers, or driving hyper-personalized experiences, generative AI is helping banks innovate and differentiate. From fraud detection to agentic contracts and even smarter onboarding, AI isn’t just a buzzword; it’s a game-changer. In curated news, Checkout ended 2024 on a high note with 45% revenue growth, signaling a strong push toward profitability. Ramp is stepping into digital banking with its new Treasury product, offering businesses liquidity and higher yields. And Pluto just secured $4.1 million to fuel its expansion in KSA, further strengthening its position in the region. There’s so much more to unpack, but I’ll save the rest for next time. As always, feel free to hit reply and share your thoughts—I’d love to hear what’s on your mind! Insights PaaS Revenue Opportunities for Financial Businesses and Their Corporate Clients Here’s how they do it: 1. Cross-Border Transactions and Currency Conversion Large commercial enterprises often engage in cross-border trade, necessitating efficient and cost-effective management of international payments. PaaS solutions streamline cross-border transactions by providing real-time currency conversion and competitive exchange rates. This capability helps businesses manage foreign exchange risks and reduce transaction costs. For example, a global manufacturing company can use PaaS to pay suppliers in many countries, ensuring supply chain diversification and timely and accurate payments in various currencies. 2. Multichannel Payment Acceptance Enterprises that operate in multiple markets need to accept payments through various channels, including online, mobile, and on-premises. PaaS platforms offer a unified solution for integrating different payment methods, such as credit cards, digital wallets, and bank transfers. This flexibility enhances customer experience and increases sales opportunities. For instance, an international retailer can use PaaS to provide a seamless payment experience across its e-commerce site, mobile app, and physical warehouses worldwide. 3. Automated, Integrated Accounts Payable Large enterprises have complex accounts payable processes involving numerous vendors and invoices. PaaS solutions can automate these processes, from invoice receipt to payment execution, ensuring accuracy and efficiency. By integrating PaaS, a global corporation can automate payments to its suppliers, improving cash flow management and liquidity and reducing the risk of errors or delays. 4. Fraud Detection and Prevention As businesses manage an increasing volume of global payments, the risk of fraud also rises. PaaS platforms incorporate advanced security features like machine learning algorithms and real-time monitoring to detect and prevent fraudulent activities. A multinational company can leverage these capabilities to safeguard its transactions and comply with international security standards, thus protecting its financial assets and reputation.

Porter in 1979, remains a cornerstone for analysing the competitive forces that shape industries and strategies within organisations. This framework provides a structured lens through which to examine not just the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) but the broader spectrum of modern organisational challenges and opportunities. This post focuses on how organisations across various industries can use Porter’s Five Forces, alongside AI and machine learning, to navigate the complexities and challenges of the contemporary business landscape. Porter’s Five Forces Model (PFFM) Porter’s model lists five ‘forces’ that drive competitive pressure within an industry. These are: Competitive Rivalry Supplier Power Buyer Power Threat of Substitution Threat of New Entry Organisations naturally tend to focus on their direct competitors. The result is that these entities can be blindsided by less obvious threats. By using PFFM, organisations take a broad perspective on the competitive landscape. Competitive Rivalry This is the force of direct competition. In this phase, an organisation considers the following: How many competitors there are (and who they are) The quality of their competing products In a market which contains many competitors, organisations typically compete by lowering prices. Organisations can also compete by providing a product that is far superior to those of competitors – although this can be extremely challenging. Impact of AI on Competitive Rivalry: AI-driven industries, including generative AI and NLP, are marked by intense competition, driven by rapid technological advancements and a plethora of active players ranging from tech giants to smaller startups. This rivalry shapes the strategic decisions organisations must make to sustain their competitive position. Generative AI and NLP: Competition in generative AI and NLP is particularly fierce, with major players like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook continuously pushing the envelope. To stay competitive, organisations must invest in cutting-edge research and forge strategic partnerships. Product Development and Prompt Engineering: In the realm of product development, prompt engineering has emerged as a crucial skill. Crafting effective prompts can significantly enhance the performance of LLMs in specific tasks, offering a competitive advantage. Agentic Workflows: The integration of AI into agentic workflows—where AI agents autonomously perform complex tasks—can revolutionise productivity and operational efficiency. Supplier Power The greater the number of actual or potential suppliers an organisation has, the more power it has over individual suppliers, and the better it is able to secure relevant products or services. The inverse situation applies if there are few suppliers. Impact of AI on Supplier Power: In the AI and ML industry, suppliers primarily consist of data providers, cloud computing services, and specialised hardware manufacturers. The bargaining power of these suppliers can significantly impact an organisation’s operational efficiency and cost structure. Cloud Computing and Hardware: Cloud service providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure offer scalable computing resources essential for training and deploying AI models. Additionally, specialised hardware suppliers, such as NVIDIA for GPUs, hold significant influence. Data Providers: Access to quality data is paramount for training effective AI models. Organisations can mitigate this power by developing in-house data collection capabilities or leveraging synthetic data generation techniques to supplement their datasets. Buyer Power Buyer power measures the options an organisation’s customers have in the market. If customers only have a few options from which to procure a product or service, then buyers have less “buyer power”. If there are many suppliers, then the buyers have greater “buyer power.” The organisation’s power is inversely proportional to the buyer’s power. Impact of AI on Buyer Power: Buyers in various industries now expect high-quality, reliable, and customisable AI solutions. Large enterprises possess significant bargaining power due to their financial resources and ability to negotiate favourable terms. End consumers’ power rises as awareness and understanding of AI technologies grow. Consumers increasingly expect transparency, privacy, and ethical considerations in AI products. Regulatory Bodies: Regulatory authorities impose standards and compliance requirements that organisations must meet. The growing focus on ethical AI and data privacy regulations has heightened the power of regulatory bodies. Threat of Substitution The threat of substitution refers to the ability of an organisation’s customers to find a substitute for its services or products. Here, a substitute refers to a different way of achieving the same – or a superior – outcome. Impact of AI on the Threat of Substitution: Traditional Software Solutions: Traditional software solutions can sometimes substitute for AI-based applications, particularly if they offer the required functionality at a lower cost. Emerging Technologies: New technological advancements, such as quantum computing and edge AI, could potentially substitute existing AI and ML solutions. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): This hybrid approach can outperform purely generative models in specific applications, necessitating continuous innovation and adaptation by organisations. Threat of New Entry This is a measure of the barrier to entry for new players (competitors) in the market. A low barrier to entry is bad for an incumbent, and a high barrier to entry is good for an incumbent. Impact of AI on the Threat of New Entrants: The AI and ML industry is characterised by significant barriers to entry, primarily due to the high capital requirements for research and development (R&D), the need for specialised talent, and the complexities of regulatory compliance. Open-source frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers have democratised access to sophisticated AI tools, enabling startups and smaller enterprises to compete with established players. Generative AI and LLMs: These models require substantial computational resources for training and fine-tuning. However, organisations can leverage existing pre-trained models and focus on fine-tuning them for specific applications, reducing the initial investment and technical requirements. Open Source and Model Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuning models on proprietary data allows new entrants to create competitive products without developing models from scratch. Conclusion Porter’s Five Forces model offers a comprehensive framework for organisations across various industries to analyse their competitive environment and formulate strategic initiatives. By understanding the threats and opportunities presented by new entrants, suppliers, buyers, substitutes, and industry rivalry, organisations can better navigate the complexities of the modern business landscape. In particular, leveraging open-source resources, focusing on model fine-tuning, staying abreast of regulatory developments, investing in emerging technologies, and excelling in AI-driven workflows can provide substantial competitive advantages.

In this “agentic” age of commerce, autonomous AI agents are increasingly capable of making purchases, managing finances, and executing transactions on behalf of\r\n users without direct human intervention. What began as experimental chatbots has rapidly evolved into full-fledged agentic AI systems with “advanced human-like reasoning and interaction capabilities” that are “transforming the\r\n finance and retail sectors” among others. In just the past few months, major payment networks, fintech giants, and startups alike have unveiled tools to empower these AI agents to shop, pay, and transact in the real world. This deep dive\r\n explores how the concept of agentic AI emerged in payments and commerce, what key solutions are being built – from PayPal’s Agent Toolkit to Visa’s Intelligent Commerce – and what it all means for consumers, merchants, and the broader fintech ecosystem. The significance of this shift is hard to overstate. Some compare it to the leap from physical stores to e-commerce, or from web shopping to mobile. As Visa’s Chief Product and Strategy Officer Jack Forestell put it, “Just like the shift from physical\r\n shopping to online, and from online to mobile, Visa is setting a new standard for a new era of commerce” with AI agents. The idea is that soon millions of consumers will trust AI assistants to not only find the perfect product or best deal, but also buy\r\n it for them – all while handling payments seamlessly in the background. According to Forestell, “Soon people will have AI agents browse, select, purchase and manage on their behalf. These agents will need to be trusted with payments, not only\r\n by users, but by banks and sellers as well” . In other words, the race is on to build the trust, infrastructure, and standards that will let AI-driven commerce flourish safely. This isn’t just hype from incumbents. A wave of startups and developers is also charging into the agentic payments gold rush. In late 2024 and early 2025, “a surge of launches by startups [aimed] to capitalize on the new AI agent economy” has been\r\n evident. Fintech innovators see an opportunity to remove friction from transactions by letting AI do the heavy lifting. But they also recognize huge challenges around security, identity, and fraud when algorithmic agents start handling money. Are\r\n we really ready to let AI agents loose on our wallets? This article will delve into how the industry is addressing those questions and reimagining commerce itself – from autonomous shopping assistants to AI-powered back-office bots – all through the lens\r\n of factual developments and solutions that have emerged in the past year. The Rise of Agentic AI in Commerce Not long ago, “autonomous AI agents” sounded like science fiction. Yet the rapid advances in generative AI (GenAI) and large language models over 2023–2024 have made it possible for software bots to carry out complex tasks with minimal supervision.\r\n Instead of just answering questions, AI can now be agentic – capable of making decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals. In practical terms, an agentic AI might not only recommend a product but actually place an order ,\r\n or not only flag a fraudulent transaction but automatically shut down the affected account. The concept took center stage as companies like OpenAI released frameworks for AI agents that can use tools and APIs. This opened the door for integrating\r\n payment capabilities directly into AI workflows. Financial services quickly became fertile ground for these innovations. According to a PwC executive playbook, “multimodal GenAI agentic frameworks have emerged as transformative catalysts, enabling businesses to accelerate process automation at an unprecedented\r\n scale” , with finance and retail among the sectors already seeing impact. Early experiments had AI agents assist with things like investment research, loan document analysis, and customer support. By late 2024, attention turned to payments and\r\n commerce – arguably the next frontier for agentic AI. After all, shopping and financial transactions involve myriad routine decisions and steps (searching for products, comparing options, entering payment details, etc.) that an AI could potentially\r\n handle faster and more efficiently than a human. Crucially, the infrastructure to support such autonomy was starting to fall into place. Payment APIs have proliferated, digital wallets and tokenization are widespread, and e-commerce is API-driven – all of which make it easier to plug an AI agent into the\r\n commerce loop. In October 2024, industry observers like Sardine noted that “AI agents are the hottest trend in banking right now, offering massive productivity gains by automating complex tasks and making decisions at lightning speed – tasks that once\r\n required human oversight” . However, as Sardine’s Head of Strategy Ravi Loganathan cautioned, this promise comes with challenges: “How do you know the AI agent is operating within your consent? How do you link each payment back to a verified identity?\r\n How do we prevent fraud against the agents or prevent the agents from committing fraud?” . These questions underscored the need for new frameworks and safeguards before handing the keys (and the credit cards) to AI. By early 2025, the concept of agentic commerce had moved from theory to reality. In April and May 2025, a flurry of announcements from top payments companies signaled that autonomous shopping and payments are officially here. Mastercard\r\n unveiled its Agent Pay initiative; Visa introduced Intelligent Commerce ; PayPal, Stripe, and Coinbase each launched toolkits for AI agent transactions; and startups like PayOS came out of stealth to tie everything together.

Start for Free Ivan Kitov • 6 Mar 2023 • 4 min read Buyers are the people who pay for a company’s products and services. In fact, consumer behavior is what really drives a firm’s profits. As such, buyers often demand low prices and high quality. Lowering prices may affect revenues while increasing quality could inflate production costs. Basically, the power of buyers determines how you set your prices. Knowing the bargaining power of your customers creates a strong competitive advantage for your organization. Determining Factors When we talk about buyers, you should know that those are not necessarily the end-users! A large toy manufacturer, for example, may have a number of store chains as customers. Broadly speaking, a buyer power analysis includes the following industry-specific determinants: Concentration of buyers deals with the number of customers that purchase goods and services from a producer. As scarce client concentration makes companies highly dependent on their consumers, any transaction makes a big difference for producers. Thus, such buyers exert strong bargaining power. By contrast, a densely populated client base undermines buyer power. Sales Percentage has to do with the size of a client. For example, a buyer that contributes to 50% of a company’s annual revenue is surely more powerful than the ones bringing 1% or less. Undifferentiated products are usually a prerequisite for a high buyer power, where brand loyalty is low. Many firms selling the same thing allows buyers to become more powerful and look for the best deal on the market. In this way, customers can easily switch providers as they like. Switching costs relate to the costs involved in changing providers. High switching costs mostly presuppose low buyer power. Backward integration is another factor to consider. A buyer that starts manufacturing a product or service in-house will no longer need to purchase it from a provider. This is what we call a threat of backward integration. Information accessibility plays a key role in the bargaining power of buyers as well. If customers know too much about a product, its features and production costs, they may ask for lower prices. Price sensitivity touches on the price sentiment of buyers. Sensitive buyers may switch providers because of a price change. If so, producers are then forced to respect clients’ wishes, giving them the upper hand in the bargaining process. Substitutes refer to market alternatives. Customers with many product options to choose from outpower the providers selling them. Strong Bargaining Power of Buyers When you buy a plane ticket, you usually have many airlines to choose from. You usually enter your travel criteria on the internet and look for the best deal. You are not obliged to use a particular airline; in fact, you may try out a new one every time you travel, so no switching costs are involved. Some itineraries even allow for different means of transportation. For the most part, you focus on the price rather than the brand. Nowadays, flying has turned into a commodity product, thus buyers have high bargaining power. Typically, a strong buyer power presupposes that: Buyers are relatively fewer than sellers Switching costs are low Backward integration is attainable Substitutes are available Buyers are very price sensitive Products are not differentiated Buyers acquire the product in bulk Weak Bargaining Power of Buyers Microsoft’s former general managers wrote the following to Bill Gates back in 1997: “ It is this switching cost that has given our customers the patience to stick with Windows through all our mistakes, our buggy drivers, and many other difficulties. ” This is a typical example of weak buyer power. In practice, the bargaining power of buyers is considered low (or weak) when: Buyers are more than sellers Switching costs are high Backward integration is unattainable No substitutes are available Products are differentiated Buyer Bargaining Power: A Practical Look Let’s take a look at the bargaining power of buyers from a more practical perspective. With over 11,000 stores, Walmart stands as one of the biggest international retail stores in the world. It sells hundreds of different brands to its customers, but it is quite a buyer itself, too. In other words, it functions as both – seller and buyer. As a seller, Walmart deals with many buyers on a daily basis. Contrary to popular belief, those customers exert moderate power over the retail giant. That’s because the store’s low prices and convenience are difficult to find anywhere else. As a result, the company does not feel much pressure from customers when it comes to pricing. At the same time, the constant need for specific new brands that are currently not in stock weakens Walmart’s power as a buyer and strengthens the power of its customers. Now, let’s analyze Walmart as a buyer. As such, the store chain purchases products from different suppliers.  For those producers, Walmart is a buyer, one of the main players to supply products or services to. With the large purchasing volumes and broad customer reach, Walmart thus appears to be a buyer of high power. That’s why its suppliers make sure they cater to its needs at all times. They even build their operational centers adjacent to the store locations, simply to meet Walmart’s demands. And if a supplier isn’t able to accommodate its requests, Walmart is confident enough to just switch to a different one. All this makes the department store a remarkably powerful buyer. Of course, companies like Coca Cola are some of the very few that can overpower Walmart, as they are equally strong and can supply the end customers by themselves. The Bottom Line The bargaining power of buyers is extremely important to providers, but it does not tell us the whole story. The bargaining power of suppliers and the threat of new entrants are other key components involved in the model which we recommend reviewing next. To gain a better understanding of a firm’s competitive position, one should conduct a complete Porter’s 5 Forces analysis.

The current conversation around agentic AI in advertising is missing the point. Yes, it will reshape bidding strategies and improve our targeting. However, the most meaningful change is something few are talking about: Agentic AI won’t just change the delivery system; it will rewrite the advertising experience altogether. Agentic AI will fundamentally change consumers’ expectations and tolerance levels for brand interactions and the ad industry’s balance of power regarding data. We’re standing on the precipice of a new standard for our industry—where ads are no longer delivering messages but services to be rendered. Flying Cars, Not Faster Horses With agentic AI, the ad industry can’t settle for iterative improvement. We can’t give people faster horses when they’re demanding flying cars. If we focus on agentic AI to enhance targeting, bidding, and optimization, the industry will have completely missed the boat. With agentic AI, consumers will become accustomed to getting answers, not just being linked to information. An interruption to this flow simply won’t be tolerated by consumers, which will require the ad industry to rethink what it means to advertise entirely. What will that look like in practice? First, ads must become capable of interaction—responding to questions, providing recommendations, and adapting messages based on user input. Second, they must show up at the right moment and in the right form; contextual alignment will be essential. Third, ads must know when not to show up; advertisers won’t be able to blast impressions everywhere and take a victory lap when they achieve a tenth of a percent engagement rate. This isn’t about inserting ads into AI-generated answers. (That’s called spam.) It’s about creating conditions for users to engage with brand agents willingly and on their terms—like getting a helpful recommendation from a trusted source, not being handed a flyer. The future of ad infrastructure must be built around permission-based entry, context-driven prompts, and clear value in every interaction. Shift Away from Interruption There’s another major piece to this: data. As consumers lean into AI-driven assistants, these agents will become the most powerful data and consumer intelligence sources the world has ever seen. Brands’ first-party data sets—even those of leading retailers with significant transactional insights—will pale in comparison. This power shift will have profound implications for the future digital ad economy. But it will also free brands from their obsessive pursuits of first-party data at all costs and allow them to spend more time figuring out how to become truly helpful to people. AI has already upended search and altered the course of the open web. People have stopped searching and started asking. They don’t want to click, decipher, and distill. They want a clear, clean answer, and they want it now. In this new environment, brands can’t just shout for attention. They need to behave like guides. If I’m in-market for a car, I don’t want an offer interrupting my experience. I want help making a decision. What should I know? What should I compare? What’s available near me? A brand experience powered by agentic AI can do that. It stops being an ad and starts being a recommendation engine. It’s not a pop-up. It’s a conversation. There’s a flip side: If the brand’s agent isn’t helpful, it won’t survive. AI agents are built on trust. Users will shut them down when they break that trust by pushing something irrelevant or aggressive. The Industry Must Think Bigger A lot of what’s being said about agentic AI today feels like old ideas in new packaging: better targeting, smarter bidding, and dynamic optimization. That’s fine. But if that’s the ceiling of our imagination, advertising is doomed. AI will change consumer expectations and how they interact with content, and the advertising experience will have to evolve accordingly. The future of advertising is not optimization. It’s ads as a service. Agentic AI won’t just change how we reach people. It will change why they bother to listen. And the brands that win will be the ones who show up when needed, speak clearly, and offer something valuable—no tap, no scroll, no ask required.

Press enter or click to view image in full size A rtificial Intelligence is transforming financial services across traditional institutions, fintech upstarts, and emerging domains. This transformation spans predictive AI (data-driven models for forecasting and automation), generative AI (GenAI — AI that creates content like text, code, or synthetic data), and agentic AI (autonomous AI agents that can perceive, reason, and act with minimal human input). Notably, agentic AI goes beyond GenAI — instead of merely responding to prompts, it can independently make decisions, collaborate with other agents, and continuously learn, much like a human team. GenAI relies on human instructions and can’t handle complex multi-step tasks alone, whereas agentic AI networks “ learn, adapt and work together — making decisions and improving continuously ”. All three forms are finding powerful use cases in finance. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that generative AI alone could add $200-$340 billion annually (~3–5% of revenues) to the banking sector, signaling the immense potential across all financial domains. Below, we explore major sectors and use cases, with structured insights on real-world applications, benefits, leading adopters, methodologies for identifying opportunities, challenges, and ROI metrics. To illustrate the breadth of impact, the table below highlights a few prominent AI implementations and outcomes in financial services: Press enter or click to view image in full size Examples of AI, Generative AI, and Agentic AI use cases across financial sectors and their impact. (Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance / World Economic Forum) Each sector below is organized with specific AI, GenAI, and agentic AI use cases; examples of efficiencies and outcomes; key players driving innovation; approaches to identifying use cases; challenges and ethical considerations; and metrics for impact. 1. Traditional Finance and Financial Services Banking (Retail, Commercial, Investment, Private Banking) Key AI Use Cases — AI is reinventing how banks operate and serve customers. In retail banking , AI-driven customer service bots and smart apps have become mainstream. For example, Bank of America’s “ Erica ” virtual assistant handles routine inquiries, gives spending insights, and even cracks the occasional joke — it has engaged 42 million customers with over 2.5 billion interactions, performing tasks from subscription tracking to personalized budgeting tips. AI also powers fraud detection and cybersecurity in banking: models continuously scan transactions and login patterns to flag suspicious behavior. JPMorgan Chase uses real-time ML analytics to monitor for fraud across millions of credit card transactions, helping it and networks like Visa prevent fraud losses in the moment [1]. In credit and lending , banks apply AI for credit scoring and loan underwriting — evaluating far more variables than traditional scorecards. AI-based credit models can incorporate customers’ banking history, payments, and even text data; for instance, several U.S. banks partner with fintechs to use AI scoring that safely approves more borrowers (Upstart’s model increased approvals ~43% while halving defaults). Risk management is another focus: banks use AI for predictive analytics in everything from loan default prediction to liquidity management. In investment banking and capital markets divisions , AI assists traders and analysts by sifting news and market data for insights (e.g. NLP models summarizing earnings calls), and even automating parts of trade execution and portfolio hedging. Agentic AI is emerging here — imagine a trading agent autonomously monitoring market trends, deciphering signals, and adjusting strategies in real-time. In fact, banks are piloting such capabilities: an AI agent can now integrate with market data feeds and APIs to “ respond to new information…and automate financial tasks beyond GenAI’s capabilities ”, such as dynamic portfolio rebalancing or real-time hedging without waiting on human prompts. Enhancing Efficiency & Outcomes — Across banking, AI and automation are boosting productivity and outcomes. Customer-facing AI (chatbots, personalized recommendations) enhances experience and sales: for example, large banks use AI-driven “ next best action ” engines to suggest tailored offers (cards, savings plans) to customers, increasing cross-sell conversion and customer satisfaction. Internally, AI automates labor-intensive processes. JPMorgan’s COIN platform (a natural-language AI) reviewed legal contracts in seconds — work that once took 360,000 hours of lawyers’ time [2]. Likewise, a regional U.S. bank used GenAI coding assistants to help developers, boosting software development productivity ~40%. AI-powered fraud detection has markedly reduced losses — PayPal, for instance, shifted from reactive fraud handling to AI that proactively flags anomalies as transactions occur, sharply cutting fraud incidence [1]. These efficiencies are crucial as banks face cost pressures. A 2025 BCG survey noted that only ~25% of banks have moved past siloed AI pilots to deploy at scale — but those that have are reaping significant ROI in productivity and profitability. Generative AI is further supercharging efficiency: it’s being used to auto-generate code, draft financial research, answer customer emails, and summarize compliance reports — tasks that consumed countless employee hours. For example, generative AI can “ prepare drafts of pitch books and summarize regulatory reports ” for bankers, accelerating deal prep and compliance. Looking ahead, agentic AI promises even greater autonomy: routine processes like loan approvals, document review and trade settlement will soon be executed by AI agents with minimal human input [2], potentially cutting process times from days to minutes. Leading Players & Initiatives — U.S. banking giants are leading AI adoption. JPMorgan Chase has over 300 AI use cases in production and tops industry AI hiring. It developed “ IndexGPT ” to let clients create custom investment indices via GPT-4, and applies AI in areas from trading (its LOXM AI optimizes European equity trades) to customer service. Bank of America heavily invested in AI (holding 600+ AI patents); its Erica assistant is an industry showcase, and it uses AI for fraud and internal operations. Capital One rebuilt itself as a “tech-first” bank, deploying AI for real-time fraud detection, cloud optimization, and customer analytics — it’s among the fastest in AI talent growth. In Europe, BBVA stands out — it scaled an “AI Factory” model to embed AI across Spain, Mexico, and beyond, achieving notable improvements in customer acquisition and cost reduction. HSBC, Deutsche Bank, and Barclays have invested in AI hubs focusing on everything from algorithmic trading to anti-money-laundering (AML) analytics. Asian leaders include Ping An (China), which built an AI-driven personal finance ecosystem, and DBS (Singapore), known for its AI-enhanced digital banking. Collaboration is also notable: Morgan Stanley partnered with OpenAI to deploy GPT-4 for advisor assistance, and several banks (e.g. BNY Mellon, UBS ) have innovation labs with Big Tech ( Google, IBM ) to co-develop AI solutions. Methodologies to Discover Use Cases — Leading banks start by aligning AI initiatives to core business strategy and pain points, rather than adopting tech for tech’s sake. Many use structured frameworks to identify and prioritize use cases. For example, Gartner’s “ Use-Case Prism ” plots potential AI projects by their value a",

SEE FULL BIO By Leo Schwartz Senior Writer Leo Schwartz Senior Writer Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation. SEE FULL BIO Patrick Collison, cofounder and CEO of Stripe, during a House hearing in March on stablecoins. Win McNamee—Getty Images The fintech giant Stripe is developing a new blockchain, according to a recent job posting on a site for the crypto lobby group Blockchain Association. “Tempo is a high-performance, payments-focused blockchain,” reads the job advertisement, which is for a product marketing position and dated Aug. 3. The posting goes on to say that Tempo is in stealth, has a team of five, and is being built in partnership with Paradigm—a crypto venture capital firm whose cofounder and managing partner, Matt Huang, is on the board of Stripe.  Applicants for the marketing position should have “experience marketing to a Fortune 500 audience,” per the ad. The blockchain is a layer 1, or not built on top of other protocols, and it’s compatible with the coding language used on the blockchain Ethereum, according to four sources briefed on the matter. All sources requested anonymity to talk about private business conversations. Spokespeople for Stripe and Paradigm declined to comment. The job posting was taken down after Fortune reached out to both companies. Tempo is the latest bet on crypto from Stripe, which has grown to an almost $92 billion valuation on the back of payment products like easy online checkout and automated invoicing for businesses. In October, Stripe announced it was paying $1.1 billion for the stablecoin infrastructure firm Bridge, its largest acquisition to date. And in June, the payments titan said it bought the crypto wallet developer Privy. (It didn’t disclose the  price.) Stripe’s crypto shopping spree comes amid a rush of interest in stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar. Boosters say the crypto assets are a more effective payment technology than legacy financial infrastructure like SWIFT or wires. They also argue that the technology can reduce cross-border payment costs as well as cut down on transaction fees, among other benefits. Although stablecoins have existed for more than a decade, broader interest in the technology has picked up steam over the past year, especially after President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law in July. The bill outlines federal regulatory guidance and rules for the burgeoning sector of crypto. Stablecoins have become such a buzzy subject in the world of payments that even Big Tech giants like Meta , Apple , and Airbnb are exploring stablecoin integrations —but Stripe is leading the charge. “We are now seeing meaningful business interest in stablecoins as the underlying technology has matured,” Patrick Collison, cofounder and CEO of Stripe, said in testimony to the House in March. Stripe’s acquisition of Bridge gives the fintech ownership of a platform that helps companies integrate stablecoins into their payment flows and issue their own. And its purchase of Privy gives it the ability to build out crypto wallets for customers to help them manage their holdings. A new blockchain would allow it to control another layer in the stablecoin tech stack—the servers that process stablecoin transactions. Stripe hasn’t publicly stated its reasons for building a blockchain. It also hasn’t said it intends to issue a cryptocurrency to support it—a common move for founders of a new crypto protocol. Update, Aug. 11, 2025 : This article has been updated to note that the job posting has since been taken down after Fortune reached out to Stripe and Paradigm for comment.

But with closer inspection, the real release is focused on the vast majority of ChatGPT’s users, which is the 700m+ free userbase that is growing rapidly. Power users should be disappointed; this release wasn’t for them . The real consumer opportunity for OpenAI lies with the largest user base, and getting the unmonetized users who currently use ChatGPT infrequently in their day-to-day to indirectly pay is their largest opportunity. Analysts focused on the model capabilities are missing the much larger context of network effects that ChatGPT is gaining quickly. In November of 2023, ChatGPT wasn’t even in the top 100 websites; now it is number 5. Larger than X/Twitter, Reddit, Whatsapp, Wikipedia, and quickly approaching Instagram, Facebook, Youtube and Google. On the top 10 list, every single property is much older than ChatGPT.com, and the sheer number of unmonetized users is staggering. But that changes with GPT-5. OpenAI is laying the groundwork to monetize one of the largest and fastest-growing web properties in the world, and it all begins with the router. The Router is the Release On OpenAI’s release website , the second paragraph is about the “One United System,” specifically focused on the router . The wording is instructive. GPT‑5 is a unified system with a smart, efficient model that answers most questions, a deeper reasoning model (GPT‑5 thinking) for harder problems, and a real ‑time router that quickly decides which to use based on conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and your explicit intent (for example, if you say “think hard about this” in the prompt). The router is continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models, preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over time . Once usage limits are reached, a mini version of each model handles remaining queries. In the near future, we plan to integrate these capabilities into a single model. The router serves multiple purposes on both the cost and performance side. On the cost side, routing users to mini versions of each model allows OpenAI to service users with lower costs. On the performance side, it will enable many users to use thinking aka CoT (Chain of Thought) reasoning for the first time. Over 99% of the free users have yet to interact with a thinking model like o3, and for the average user, ChatGPT just got a huge upgrade. The number of free users exposed to thinking models went up 7x in the first day and the number of paying users up nearly 3.5x. Source: OpenAI, SemiAnalysis But the router is clearly a feature to the new service, and can likely see improvements or changes over time. It will continuously learn on preference rates and OpenAI promises it will improve over time. It just takes a single additional attribute to begin the path to monetization: the commercial value of the query. We believe that the Router is the groundwork for the next leg of ChatGPT’s story, and that’s monetization of free users. The Router is Preparing for Free Monetization, Sam’s Subtle Tone Shift Centralizing the control of the free user experience allows for many more future monetization paths. And this monetization path is one that has been hinted at subtly for a while. It all starts with OpenAI’s decision to hire Fidji Simo as CEO of Applications in May . Let’s look at her background because it’s telling. Fidji was at Ebay from 2007 to 2011, but her defining career was primarily at Facebook. She was Vice President and Head of Facebook, and she is known for having a superpower to monetize. She was critical in rolling out videos that autoplay, improving the Facebook feed, and monetizing mobile and gaming. She might be one of the most qualified individuals alive to turn high-intent internet properties into ad products, and now she’s at the fastest-growing internet property of the last decade that is unmonetized. It’s an obvious story. What’s more is Sam Altman himself has had a very direct tone shift in the last year. “I will disclose as a personal bias I hate ads. I think ads were important to give the early internet a business model. I’m not totally against them, but ads plus AI are uniquely unsettling to me. I kind of think of ads as a last resort as a business model. ” But in recent interviews his tone has now shifted. There is clearly a lot of thought happening about how to best monetize free users more recently. This likely is in conjunction with Simo’s hiring. “I am not totally against it… if you compare us to social media or web search where you can kinda tell that you are being monetized… we would hate to ever modify anything in the stream of an LLM… maybe if you click on something in there that is going to be there we’d show anyway, we’ll get a bit of transaction revenue and it’s a flat thing for everything, maybe that could work. It’s clearly possible to be a good ad driven company but there are obviously issues to it. Compared to the previous conversation, when he was dismissive, his most recent thoughts clearly shows that Sam Altman is thinking about monetizing free users. He mentions a take rate a potential affiliate model. And as a response, the interviewer ( Andrew Mayne of OpenAI ) literally says, “I would love to do all my purchasing through ChatGPT because often times I feel like I am not making the most informed decisions,” as a response in the conversation. This is likely the direction OpenAI is taking. The Router release can now understand the intent of the user’s queries, and importantly, can decide how to respond. It only takes one additional step to decide whether the query is economically monetizable or not. Today we will make our case for how ChatGPT’s monetized free end state could look like an Agentic super-app for the consumer. This is only possible because of routing. We believe that display ads are unlikely. Perplexity has tried this, and it doesn’t seem to be going that well. Instead of inserting a paid feature into the query, we believe it’s more likely that they will pursue a take-rate based model. Now let’s discuss, because it looks like an Agentic Assistant is a way that could align Sam Altman’s vision of AI being helpful, as well as monetizing via a transaction take rate. Agentic Advice and Purchasing, Supply and Demand Dynamics Let’s talk about Agentic purchasing and compare it to a search query today. Because LLMs have a core feature that Search does not, and that is scaling marginal costs. This is fundamentally different than the world search grew up in. Let’s examine “ Aggre",

If 2023 was the AI Big Bang*, 2025 feels like First Light. The fog of the early calamity is lifting— revealing clusters of foundational companies, best practices for building, and patterns for startup success. We’re still a ways from declaring any semblance of stability, but these early AI Galaxies give us more visibility than ever of the shape of things to come. We should first state unequivocally that we are extremely confident that AI is driving the biggest wave of technology change we’ve ever seen. Founders are right to wonder how to separate hype from reality any time VCs open their mouths—but in the case of AI, simple numbers tell the tale. If the most straightforward measure of startup reality is revenue growth, we’ve updated our benchmarks and focused on 20 astonishing AI startups to help define what a great AI startup looks like. While these benchmarks will undoubtedly evolve in the coming years, it’s clear that what constituted a great startup in the SaaS era doesn’t quite cut it anymore. There is no cloud without AI anymore. Of course, the AI era isn’t delivering uniformly good news for startups and investors. Some growth signals can be misleading. Buyers are hungry, AI demos dazzle, sales can spike, but not all products deliver real value. Retention can be fragile, especially when switching costs are low. Early hypergrowth alone means less now than ever before. And Big Bangs are hard to ignore, thus competitive intensity is at an all-time high. Promising areas are attracting 2–3x the rivals of years past. On top of this, SaaS giants are waking up to the AI imperative including many in our portfolio, such as Intercom who have already launched a $100M+ AI product. We suspect these leaders will offer increased competitive pressure (as well as M&A temptation!) in the coming years. We’re also still in a moment of wild unpredictability. Our heads may be spinning slightly slower this year, but they are still spinning. Implications of developments in Model Context Protocol (MCP), AI browsers, and many other areas we’ll label “dark matter” in this report still have us scratching our heads with only vague guesses on how portions of this AI universe will evolve. One thing is for certain, however. There is no cloud without AI anymore. At Bessemer, we’ve already deployed over $1 billion in capital to AI-native startups since our initial commitment in 2023. In addition, essentially every legacy SaaS company is leveraging AI in their product and operations. Whether or not we feel fully equipped to navigate this new AI universe, we are all in it now. In this State of AI report, we aim to: Share our latest Benchmarks for what great AI startups look like Tour our Roadmaps across Infrastructure, Developer Tools, Horizontal AI, Vertical AI, and Consumer while highlighting the stable galaxies in each space—where constellations are forming Surface the dark matter —important areas with major questions unanswered Offer our five predictions for what we expect to see in the year or two ahead. The fuzzy map of the AI universe that follows is for startup travelers who can tolerate a voyage where rules of the road are being rewritten in real time. The ride ahead may be bumpy, but at least it won’t be boring. And we’re here for it. Let’s dive in. Bessemer's State of AI 2025 report *Debates continue over the true AI Big Bang—some point to 2012’s AlexNet breakthrough in deep learning; others to OpenAI’s 2020 scaling laws. For this report, we consider the mass release of ChatGPT as the moment AI truly exploded into public consciousness. AI benchmarks: What “great” startups look like in 2025 Benchmarks have always been an imperfect way to judge startups—but in the AI era, they’re even less reliable. In particular, some AI startups have achieved growth rates the world has truly never seen, driving every AI founder to wonder what good even looks like anymore. We’ve thus updated our benchmarks acknowledging that some AI startups are playing a different game. A tale of two AI startups and the new “T2D3” To formulate our new set of benchmarks we studied 20 high-growth, durable AI startups across our portfolio and beyond, including breakouts Perplexity , Abridge , and Cursor . While all of these AI stars are exhibiting astonishing growth, close study makes it clear that there are two different types of astonishing in the AI era: Supernovas and Shooting Stars. AI supernovas Supernovas are the AI startups growing as fast as any in software history. These businesses sprint from seed to $100M of ARR in no time, often in their first year of commercialization. These are at once the most exciting and the most terrifying startups we see. Almost by definition, these numbers arise from circumstances where revenue may appear vulnerable. They involve fast adoption that either belies low switching costs, or signals massive novelty that may not align with long-term value. These applications are often so close to the functionality of core foundation models that “thin wrapper” labels could be thrown. And in red hot competitive spaces, margins are often stretched close to zero or even negative as startups use every tool to fight for winner-take-all prizes. On average, ten AI Supernova startups we surveyed reached ~$40M ARR in their first year of commercialization and ~$125M ARR in the second year of revenue generation. Topline ARR, of course, doesn’t always guarantee a healthy business. Sustainable growth depends on strong retention, engagement, and capital efficiency. On average, these AI Supernovas have only 25% gross margins, often trading distribution for profit in the short term. Despite these low margins, these AI Supernovas seem to demonstrate an incredible $1.13M ARR/FTE, which is 4-5x above a typical SaaS benchmark. This revenue efficiency could indicate longer term potential for very efficient businesses at scale. Supernovas: Explosively scaling AI startups with unprecedented growth and adoption. Average benchmarks Year-1 ARR Year-2 ARR Annual Recurring Revenue $40M $125M Average Gross Margin ~25% (often negative) Year-1 ARR/FTE (Average) $1.13M AI Shooting Stars Shooting Stars, by contrast, look more like stellar SaaS companies: they find product-market fit quickly, retain and expand customer relationships, and maintain strong gross margins—slightly lower than SaaS peers due to faster growth and modest model-related costs. They grow faster on average than their SaaS predecessors, but at rates that still feel anchored to traditional bottlenecks of scaling an organization. These businesses might not yet dominate headlines, but they’re beloved by their customers and are on the trajectory to making software history. On avera",

OKX Slashes OKB Token Supply by 50% With $7.6B Burn, Price Surges ETH Transaction Volume Climbs on Price Rally, Cheaper DeFi Costs Weaponized Trading Bots Drain $1M From Crypto Users via AI-Generated YouTube Scam Babylon Introduces Trustless Bitcoin Vaults for BTC Staking Protocol Network news OKX SLASHES TOKEN SUPPLY IN HALF: OKB, the token of cryptocurrency exchange OKX, more than tripled to a record high after the company executed a one-time burn of 65.26 million OKB , cutting the supply by more than 50%. Burning the roughly $7.6 billion worth of tokens permanently reduces the maximum supply to 21 million, in line with the hard cap coded into Bitcoin. The burn, or sending the tokens to a wallet address that can't be accessed, was carried out from OKX’s reserves and represents one of the largest deflationary events in exchange token history. The effect of the burn was instant. OKB jumped to $142 from $46 before retrenching to about $102. Trading volume skyrocketed 13,000% to $723 million as traders attempted to capitalize on the supply shock. The strategy mirrors that of BNB, the token of BNB Chain, which is associated with rival exchange Binance. That undergoes quarterly burns that often precede short-term rallies. — Oliver Knight Read more . ETH TRANSACTION VOLUME CLIMBS : Ethereum’s transaction volume has been overall on an upward trajectory, closing in its all-time high of 1.9 million transactions in a single day in January 2024. The latest surge is drawing attention from both retail traders and institutional observers, as it reflects a confluence of technical improvements, favorable market sentiment, and a renewed appetite for on-chain activity. According to data from Etherscan , daily transaction counts have been consistently trending higher over the past several weeks. Other data shows seven-day averages of daily transactions have already surpassed their previous records. Analysts suggest that this momentum is being fueled by a combination of factors: a recent increase in network capacity, rising ether prices, and a reduction in transaction costs, particularly for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and stablecoin transfers. One of the biggest enablers of the current spike has been a substantial capacity boost on Ethereum’s mainnet. The Fidelity Digital Assets Research Team told CoinDesk that “Ethereum’s Layer 1 is seeing a surge in transactions largely due to a 50% increase in the gas limit since March, which allows more transactions to fit into each block.” This upgrade has significantly increased throughput, enabling more efficient settlement and reducing congestion. As a result, stablecoin transfer costs have fallen consistently below a dollar, making DeFi activity and peer-to-peer payments far more affordable. Fidelity Digital Assets notes that DeFi currently tops the charts for ETH burns, underlining its central role in driving network activity. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . WEAPONIZED TRADING BOTS STEAL $1M FROM CRYPTO USERS : Over $1 million has been siphoned from unsuspecting crypto users through malicious smart contracts posing as MEV trading bots, according to a new report by SentinelLABS. The campaign leveraged AI-generated YouTube videos, aged accounts, and obfuscated Solidity code to bypass basic user scrutiny and gain access to crypto wallets. Scammers appeared to be using AI-generated avatars and voices to reduce production costs and scale up video content. These tutorials are published on aged YouTube accounts populated with unrelated content and manipulated comment sections to give the illusion of credibility. In some cases, the videos are unlisted and likely distributed via Telegram or DMs. At the center of the scam was a smart contract promoted as a profitable arbitrage bot. Victims were instructed via YouTube tutorials to deploy the contract using Remix, fund it with ETH, and call a “Start () ” function. In reality, however, the contract routed funds to a concealed, attacker-controlled wallet, using techniques such as XOR obfuscation (which hides data by scrambling it with another value) and large decimal-to-hex conversions (which convert large numbers into wallet-readable address formats) to mask the destination address (which makes fund recovery trickier) . — Shaurya Malwa Read more . BABYLON INTRODUCES TRUSTLESS BITCOIN VAULTS : Bitcoin project Babylon took another step toward offering a decentralized finance (DeFi) experience on its $5 billion staking protocol akin to that seen elsewhere in the crypto world. The latest development is the introduction of trustless vaults, designed to allow BTC holders to deposit their tokens without relying on a centralized entity, as outlined in a new white paper shared with CoinDesk. In DeFi ecosystems, trustless vaults are a form of digital asset storage or management that removes the need for users to trust a central authority or intermediary. Instead,",
