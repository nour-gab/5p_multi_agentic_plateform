New entrants are companies that enter a market or an industry for the first time, offering a new or alternative product or service to the existing customers. New entrants can pose a serious challenge to the incumbent firms, as they may have lower costs, higher quality, better innovation, or more customer loyalty. New entrants can also disrupt the industry structure, changing the rules of the game and forcing the incumbents to adapt or exit.

New entrants are a threat because they can reduce the profitability and growth potential of the incumbent firms. New entrants can capture market share, lower prices, increase costs, or create new customer segments that the incumbents cannot serve. New entrants can also erode the competitive advantages and barriers to entry that the incumbents have built over time, such as economies of scale, brand reputation, customer loyalty, or patents.

Porter's Five Forces is a widely used framework for analyzing the competitive forces that shape an industry. This framework consists of five factors: industry rivalry, bargaining power of suppliers, bargaining power of buyers, threat of substitutes, and threat of new entrants. Examining each factor can help assess the attractiveness and profitability of an industry, as well as the potential and intensity of new entrants. The threat of new entrants depends on entry barriers, expected retaliation, and entry incentives. Entry barriers are obstacles that prevent or discourage new entrants from entering an industry; these may include high capital requirements, strong brand loyalty, patent protection, or government regulations. Expected retaliation is the reaction of incumbent firms to the entry of new competitors; this could be price wars, advertising campaigns, product differentiation, or alliances. Lastly, entry incentives are factors that motivate or attract new entrants to enter an industry; these could be high profit margins, low entry costs, unmet customer needs, or technological innovations.

Cancel Add Save Ron Ramesh CEO | Strategy | Franchising Copy link to contribution Report contribution From Porter's standpoint, industries that are low in supplier power, entry, buyer power, substitute products, and competitive rivalry are where any business would thrive.  By starting with understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the forces affecting the industry, the company can then understand its position relative to the industry, thus allowing it to understand its competitive position better.  \n\nWhen going through the exercise of identifying competitive rivals, both direct and indirect have to be considered.  Gather as much information on a competitor that includes the 4 p's of marketing, market share, and so on.  The more granular, the deeper your understanding will be of where you may or may not have a competitive advantage. …see more Like 4 How to respond to new entrants?

Peak Frameworks Team Apr 29, 2024 3 min read If you're interested in breaking into finance, check out our Private Equity Course and Investment Banking Course , which help thousands of candidates land top jobs every year. Start Preparing The Concept of the Threat of New Entrants Source: Corporate Finance Institute The Threat of New Entrants refers to the potential for new companies to enter an industry and disrupt its market dynamics, challenging existing players. This threat is pivotal for strategic planning, especially for professionals in finance, investment banking, and corporate finance sectors, as it directly impacts investment decisions and long-term profitability. Understanding this threat enables businesses to devise robust strategies to protect their market position. Factors Influencing the Threat of New Entrants Several factors determine the ease or difficulty with which new competitors can enter a market. These factors not only influence the strategic decisions of potential entrants but also shape the defensive tactics of existing businesses. Capital Requirements The need for substantial capital investment to enter an industry acts as a significant deterrent to new entrants. For instance, the pharmaceutical industry requires immense investment in research and development, regulatory approvals, and manufacturing capabilities. This high barrier to entry protects established firms from a flood of new competitors. Economies of Scale Source: The Balance Economies of scale refer to the cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to their scale of operation , with cost per unit of output generally decreasing with increasing scale. Industries like automobile manufacturing benefit significantly from economies of scale, making it challenging for new entrants without substantial capital to compete effectively. Product Differentiation In markets where companies have established strong brands and customer loyalty through unique products or services, new entrants find it challenging to gain a foothold. For example, in the technology sector, Apple's brand loyalty and product ecosystem create a significant barrier for new entrants attempting to compete in the smartphone market. Access to Distribution Channels Established companies often have exclusive agreements with key distributors or control extensive distribution networks , making it difficult for new entrants to reach potential customers. In the beverage industry, giants like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have extensive, well-established distribution networks that are difficult for new soda brands to penetrate. Regulatory and Legal Barriers Governmental policies, regulations, and legal requirements can also serve as barriers to entry. In the banking sector, for example, new entrants must navigate a complex regulatory landscape to obtain licenses and approvals, which can be both time-consuming and costly. Switching Costs High switching costs, or the costs that consumers incur to change from one product or service to another, can also protect existing firms. In the software industry, companies that use Salesforce for customer relationship management may face significant costs, both financial and in terms of time, to migrate their data and train staff on a new platform, dissuading them from switching to a new entrant's offering. Assessing the Threat Level To evaluate the threat posed by new entrants, companies should consider each of these factors in the context of their specific industry and market position. This assessment can help in identifying potential vulnerabilities and opportunities to strengthen barriers to entry. Strategic Responses to the Threat of New Entrants To mitigate the risk posed by new entrants, established firms can employ several strategies: Enhancing Product Differentiation: Developing unique products or services that offer superior value can help in retaining customer loyalty and deterring new competitors. Leveraging Economies of Scale: By increasing production volume and lowering costs, companies can set price points that are challenging for new entrants to match without significant financial backing. Strengthening Customer Relationships: Building strong relationships with customers through excellent service and engagement can increase switching costs and loyalty. Expanding Distribution Networks: Establishing comprehensive distribution channels or forming strategic alliances can limit the access new entrants have to markets. Advocating for Regulatory Barriers: In some cases, companies can influence industry regulations in a way that favors established players, although this strategy must be approached ethically and legally. Conclusion The Threat of New Entrants is a critical component of Porter's Five Forces that businesses must not overlook. By understanding and assessing this threat, finance and corporate professionals can better navigate the competitive landscape, make informed investment decisions, and develop strategies to sustain their competitive advantage. In an ever-evolving market, vigilance and strategic foresight are key to enduring success.

One of them is that it assumes that the industry structure is stable and does not change over time. However, in reality, industries are dynamic and influenced by factors such as technology, innovation, regulation, and social trends. Therefore, you need to update your analysis regularly and adapt to the changing environment. Another disadvantage is that it focuses on the external factors and ignores the internal factors that affect your business, such as your resources, capabilities, culture, and values. Therefore, you need to complement your analysis with other tools, such as SWOT analysis, VRIO framework, or value chain analysis.

Substitutes are products or services that can satisfy the same customer needs as your product or service, but in a different way or at a lower price. For example, if you sell coffee, you may face competition from tea, energy drinks, or water. To overcome the threat of substitutes, you need to create value for your customers and differentiate yourself from your alternatives. You can do this by offering superior quality, service, convenience, or loyalty programs. You can also focus on a specific segment or niche that has unique preferences or needs that are not met by the substitutes. Add your perspective Help others by sharing more (125 characters min.)

New entrants are potential competitors that can enter your industry and take away your market share or reduce your prices. The threat of new entrants depends on the barriers to entry that exist in your industry, such as economies of scale, capital requirements, brand loyalty, or legal regulations. To overcome the threat of new entrants, you need to build and maintain barriers to entry that make it difficult or costly for newcomers to enter your industry. You can do this by investing in research and development, innovation, marketing, or customer relationships. You can also leverage your network, reputation, or partnerships to create entry barriers.

standard method of organizing facts about a firm of interest to owners, regulators, tax collectors, and other stakeholders, no equivalently standard method of organizing facts about the environment of a firm is available. The closest to a standard method may be Michael Porter’s (1980) Five Forces. Porter groups the reasons for the relative successes of industries into five categories that he calls forces. These forces include two powers of closely related industries, two threats from unrelated parties, and relationships among competitors in the industry. The forces are (a) bargaining power of buyers, (b) bargaining power of sellers, (c) threat of new entrants, (d) threat of substitute products or services, and (e) rivalry am",

Index to Tools and Models Used in the Textbook Publication History Creative Commons License Recommended Citations Versioning Strategic Management 2E Analyzing the Organization’s Microenvironment When we say microenvironment (or alternatively, Competitor Environment) we are referring primarily to an organization’s industry, and the upstream and downstream markets related to it. An industry is a group of firms producing products that are close substitutes. In the course of competition, these firms influence one another. Typically, industries include a rich mix of competitive strategies that companies use in pursuing strategic competitiveness and above-average returns. In part, these strategies are chosen because of the influence of an industry’s characteristics. [1] Upstream markets are the industries that provide the raw material or inputs for the focal industry, while downstream markets are the industries (sometimes consumer segments) that consume the industry outputs. For example, the oil production market is upstream of the oil-refining market (and, conversely, the oil refiners are downstream of the oil producers), which in turn is upstream of the gasoline sales market. Instead of upstream and downstream, the terms wholesale and retail are often used. Accordingly, the industry microenvironment consists of stakeholder groups that a firm has regular dealings with. The way these relationships develop can affect the costs, quality, and overall success of a business. Porter’s Five-Forces Analysis of Market Structure You can distill the results of PESTEL and microenvironment analysis to view the competitive structure of an industry using Michael Porter’s five forces, see Figure 3.1 . Here you will find that your understanding of the microenvironment is particularly helpful. Porter’s model attempts to analyze the attractiveness of an industry by considering five forces within a market. According to Porter, the likelihood of firms making profits in a given industry depends on five factors: (1) barriers to entry and new entry threats, (2) buyer and (3) supplier bargaining power, (4) threat from substitutes, and (5) the degree of rivalry of competitors in the industry. [2] Figure 3.1 Porter’s Five Forces The industry environment has a more direct effect on the firm’s strategic competitiveness and above-average returns than the general environment. The intensity of industry competition and an industry’s profit potential (as measured by the long-run return on invested capital) are a function of these five forces of competition: the threats posed by new entrants, the power of suppliers, the power of buyers, product substitutes, and the intensity of rivalry among competitors. Porter’s five-forces model of competition expands the arena for competitive analysis. Historically, when studying the competitive environment, firms concentrated on companies with which they competed directly (competitor groups). However, firms must search more broadly to identify current and potential competitors by identifying potential customers as well as the firms serving them. Competing for the same customers and thus being influenced by how customers value location and firm capabilities in their decisions is referred to as the market microstructure. [3] Example 3.2 Understanding an Industry Using Porter’s Five Forces Electronic Arts, Inc. is a dominant player in the video game industry, competing with other firms such as Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft Entertainment, and Nintendo. The market, looking at Porter’s Five Forces, is difficult for everyone in the industry. The degree of rivalry is strong since video game players have relatively less loyalty to brands and care more about the quality of games. A brand name like EA is not enough and the company must keep developing the most cutting-edge video games to maintain its market share. The threat of new entrants is also high; the barriers of entrance in video game industry are low and a newcomer can gain market share by simply having a brilliant new game. Switching costs are low making the bargaining power of buyers strong. Consumers spend their money selectively and if one product is perceived as poor in the gaming community, its producer will face significant sales declines. For smaller companies such a retreat in the market can be devastating. The gaming industry faces a modest thr",

The threat of new entrants is a term that describes the threat posed by new companies as they enter into a market. It is one of porterâs five forces that is used in analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of an industry.Â The threat of new entrants is important to every company that is currently competing in any given market because it determines how much profit that is shared around.Â If a new company enters into a market and offers a similar product to that which is already being offered by the existing companies.Â The law of supply and demand kicks in meaning more products and less demand. As a result, the companies have to drop their prices in a bid to attract more customers which results in lower profits.Â Even without changing the prices of the products, the new company will still grab a share of the market which still entails that the existing companies get to take home less profit than they would have the new company not participating in the market.Â This is why threats of new entrants shape the market landscape by determining the level of competition and profitability of the industry.Â Two things are considered when analyzing the threat to entry in an industry. These are; is the threat of new entrants high or is it low? Hereâs why it is important.Â High threats of new entrants An industry with a high threat of new entrants will likely have a promise of high profits. This attracts new companies who then enter the industry and destabilize it either by forcing the existing companies to reduce product quality in order to maintain their profit margin or lower the prices of their products. So an industry that was once attractive with the possibility of making huge profits now has more competition and less profit potential.Â Low threats of new entrants Low threats of new entrants mean that the industry has few competitors and so existing companies hardly face any threat from new companies. Companies in industries with a low threat of new entrants thus enjoy high-profit margins for a very long time.Â So what determines if an industry has a high or low threat of new entrants? It is the barrier to entry . Barriers to entry refer to the factors or conditions that make it difficult for a new company to enter a particular industry.Â Industries with high barriers to entry will have low threats of new entrants whereas those with low barriers to entry will have higher threats of new entrants.Â Characteristics of industries with a high threat to new entrants - low initial capital requirementÂ - Poor government regulations - Lack of a strong brand identity - Low brand loyalty - Easy access to suppliers and distributorsÂ - No need for proprietary technology - No threat of retaliation from existing companiesÂ Characteristics of industries with a low threat to new entrants - high initial capital requirementÂ - Strong government regulations - Presence of companies with strong brand identitiesÂ - Limited access to suppliers and distributors - Proprietary technology needed to enter - High threats of retaliation from existing companiesÂ - Strong brand loyaltyÂ How to respond to threats of new entrants 1. By limiting pricing - existing companies can reduce the prices of products such that new companies find it difficult to compete 2. Using deterrents like showcasing the strong brand loyalty in the industry, and offering tasty promotions. 3. By applying predatory pricing tactics - existing companies can price their products way below the acceptable prices such that no profits are made.Â â Related: Barriers to entry â Related Terms Porter's five forces Barriers to Entry Ansoff Matrix Related Articles to Threats of new entrants See all posts No items found.

    "raw_content": "Google (Alphabet) Five Forces Analysis & Recommendations (Porter Model) - Panmore Institute Skip to content Panmore Institute About Privacy Policy About / Contact Privacy Policy Alphabetical List of Companies Business Analysis Topics Business , Management Google (Alphabet) Five Forces Analysis & Recommendations (Porter Model) Updated on November 14, 2024 by Nathaniel Smithson A Google Maps Car’s camera setup. This Five Forces analysis of Google (Alphabet) depicts the competitive environment and factors of the information technology, online services, and consumer electronics industries. (Photo: Public Domain) This Five Forces analysis of Google (Alphabet) accounts for the external forces that influence the company’s strategic direction in its industry environments. Michael E. Porter’s Five Forces analysis model is used to understand this strategic direction and corresponding management initiatives. Founded in 1998, the company enjoys a leading position in the online advertising market. As a large international enterprise, the technology business has operations in key strategic locations around the world. This Five Forces analysis of Google identifies the external factors in this business environment. This environment involves various industries and target markets, considering the variety of technological products and services that the company offers. The fulfillment of Google’s (Alphabet’s) vision statement and mission statement depends on the firm’s strategic management and competitive advantages in addressing the external forces assessed through Porter’s Five Forces analysis framework. This Five Forces analysis of Google considers the external factors in the industry environment involving online services, software, and hardware, in terms of the interactions of the company with the five forces of competitive rivalry/intensity of competition, bargaining power of buyers/customers, bargaining power of suppliers, threat of substitutes/substitution, and the threat of new entrants/new entry. Google’s (Alphabet’s) generic competitive strategy and intensive growth strategies relate to these external factors. Summary & Recommendations: Five Forces Analysis of Google (Alphabet) This Five Forces analysis of Google (Alphabet) considers the conditions of related but different industries and markets. For example, this external analysis accounts for the web search market, the cloud services market, and the digital advertising industry. The Five Forces in Google’s external/industry environment can be summarized as follows: Competitive rivalry or competition: Strong Force Bargaining power of buyers: Weak Force Bargaining power of suppliers: Weak Force Threat of substitutes or substitution: Moderate Force Threat of new entrants or new entry: Moderate Force Recommendations . Based on this Five Forces analysis of Google’s business, competitive rivalry or competition exerts a strong force on the company. The external factors of the threat of substitutes (substitution) and the threat of new entrants (new entry) are only moderate considerations in Alphabet’s industry environment. The bargaining power of buyers and the bargaining power of suppliers are minimally significant external factors in the information technology and online services industry. This Five Forces analysis shows that Google should focus on addressing the strong force of competition. It is recommended that the company implement strategies to further strengthen its market position and competitive advantages in Internet advertising and other online services. For example, as a technology business, Google must continually innovate and be on the cutting edge of new information technology and related technological applications. Competitive Rivalry or Competition: Strong Force Google faces the strong force of competitive rivalry or competition. In Porter’s Five Forces analysis model, competitive rivalry limits the growth of Alphabet in the technology and online services industry. Google must consider the following external factors that contribute to strong competitive rivalry: Large number of firms in the IT and online services industry (strong force) High diversity of technology firms (strong force) Low switching costs for customers (strong force) Google’s competitors span various industries, although those that have the most significant impact on the business involve Internet services or related platforms and products. For example, Alphabet’s products compete with the consumer electronics of Apple , Microsoft , Samsung, and Sony ; the digital advertising services of Facebook and eBay ; the movie streaming services of Amazon and Disney ; and the Internet connectivity services of Verizon . In the Five Forces analysis model, Alphabet’s diversity of products corresponds to a diverse set of competitors in technology industries and markets. This condition exerts a strong force on Google’s business. Moreover, customers experience low switching costs because it is easy for them to move from Google to other companies. Thus, in this part of the Five Forces analysis, the low switching costs contribute to the strong force of competition against Alphabet’s technology business. Bargaining Power of Google’s Buyers/Customers: Weak Force The bargaining power of buyers weakly affects Google’s business. Considering Porter’s Five Forces analysis model, such a weak external force has limited effect on strategic management decisions in Alphabet’s technology business. The following external factors contribute to customers’ weak bargaining power over Google: Small size of Google’s individual customers (weak force) High and increasing demand from buyers (weak force) Moderate quality of information for customers (moderate force) With only a small contribution to Google’s revenues, each buyer exerts only a weak force on the company. Because of the high and increasing demand for products from the technology corporation and its competitors, individual buyers exert only minimal influence on the business and the industry. In this Five Forces analysis of Google, the moderate quality of information refers to customers’ knowledge. For example, advertisers access analytics data that are limited in informing about the dynamics and complexity of the online advertising industry environment. The application of Google’s (Alphabet’s) marketing mix or 4Ps helps manage the bargaining power of customers evaluated in this part of the Five Forces analysis. Bargaining Power of Suppliers: Weak Force Suppliers’ power is weak against Google. In this Five Forces analysis of Alphabet, such weakness exists especially because there are many suppliers to choose from. The following external factors contribute to the weak effect of suppliers on Google: High availability of supply (weak force) Large population of suppliers (weak force) Small to moderate size of Google’s individual suppliers (weak force) The high availability of supply in combination with the large population of suppliers weakens the bargaining power of any single supplier against Google’s business. In the Five Forces analysis context, this factor means that it is relatively easy for the technology giant to move from one supplier to another. These suppliers are diverse because the online company has a diverse array of products. These suppliers include computing hardware manufacturers. In addition, many of these suppliers are small compared to Google. Given the weakness of suppliers determined in this Five Forces analysis, the technology company can impose its demands and leverage its business size against suppliers. Google’s (Alphabet’s) corporate social responsibility strategy can help align suppliers’ strategic positioning with the company’s strategic direction. In addition, the supply chain management programs and approaches used in Google’s (Alphabet’s) operations management can improve the supply chain and help manage the degree of supplier power determined in this Five Forces analysis.

The threat of new entrants is one of the competitive forces in Porter’s 5 Forces Model, where the ability of new players to enter an industry easily makes this industry more competitive and less attractive. New entrants form a threat to existing players in the industry because they bring in more capacity and increase supply, while also trying to lower prices to gain market share. This puts more pressure on the margins of the industry as a whole and reduces the profitability for everyone. Part of the ongoing strategic management process of a company is to keep analyzing the different competitive forces in the industry, including the treat of new entrants, in order to respond to them pro-actively with the right strategies. RECOMMENDED COURSE STRATEGIC  MANAGEMENT Learn about the different strategies available for each company, based on a systematic strategic analysis process. LEARN MORE Threat of New Entrants Example For example, the rise of online retail and the ability to launch a new online store at a much lower cost than brick & mortar stores has increased the threat of new entrants for the retail industry. New online retailers were able to setup shops with minimal investment, sometimes even without any inventory investment as in dropshipping, and to gain market share they were selling at lower prices than brick and mortar stores. This has reduced the margins in the industry, and created a phenomenon known as showrooming , where customers started checking out the products at the nearest brick and mortar store and completing the purchase online at the cheapest online retailer. How to Minimize The Threat of New Entrants? Threat of new entrants is minimized by enacting entry barriers by the existing players within an industry. The threat of new entrants is high when there are low, or no, entry barriers Entry Barriers Entry barriers are obstructions that make it difficult or unattractive for new players to enter an industry. The following are examples of effective entry barriers: Economies of Scale Existing big players can use their high market share and produce (or source) products in large quantities at lower costs, and thereby are able to sell those products at lower prices while still maintaining healthy margins. The new entrant will need to have the same big scale in order to be able to compete and sell at the same prices, while staying profitable. Differentiation Differentiation through branding & positioning is an effective entry barrier, because the new entrant will need to spend the same on marketing and advertising to build the same brand equity and be able to compete with established players. RECOMMENDED COURSE BRANDING & POSITIONING See how brands are built and positioned in consumers’ minds. Learn the best practices, as well as the wrong ones that didn’t work. LEARN MORE Switching Costs When buyers will need to pay high switching costs to move from one company to the other, this represents an entry barriers for new companies, as they need to convince buyers to pay those costs and switch to them. Switching costs can come in the form of setup fees, training costs or the requirement to purchase a certain device or software to use the company’s products. Capital Requirements When an industry has high capital requirements to start a business, this represents an entry barrier, as it makes it difficult for new entrants to start a business in this industry without raising that much capital. High capital requirements could be in the form of high R&D costs, equipment purchases, inventory purchases or renting and building large spaces such as brick & mortar stores, factories or warehouses. Access to Suppliers & Distribution Channels The competition for distribution channels , such as retail shelf space, makes it harder for new brands to gain access to those channels, as it is dominated by larger companies in the industry. These companies pay higher amounts for that access, or spend more on advertising their products in the market, which makes it more attractive for those distribution channels to carry and distribute their products. Join Our Channel The same also applies to access to suppliers. When bigger companies control the access to suppliers, for example through exclusivity agreements, this creates a barrier for new, smaller players to enter the industry. Government Regulations When an industry is regulated, this represents a barrier to entry, as new players will need to qualify and obtain the necessary licenses to start a business in this industry.

    "raw_content": "Burger King Five Forces Analysis & Recommendations (Porter’s Model) - Panmore Institute Skip to content Panmore Institute About Privacy Policy About / Contact Privacy Policy Alphabetical List of Companies Business Analysis Topics Business , Management Burger King Five Forces Analysis & Recommendations (Porter’s Model) Updated on May 3, 2025 by Lawrence Gregory A Burger King at the Oulu Central Square, Finland. This Five Forces analysis of Burger King highlights competition, consumers, and new firms in the fast-food restaurant industry environment. (Photo: Public Domain) This Five Forces analysis of Burger King accounts for competition and related factors involving the company and other foodservice firms that offer similar or related products, like burgers, sandwiches, beverages, and other menu items. To ensure competitiveness, Burger King addresses issues pointed out in this Five Forces analysis. Michael E. Porter’s Five Forces analysis model determines competitive forces and external factors that influence the company’s performance. In Burger King’s industry environment, major competitors are just one of the main considerations. Based on this Five Forces analysis, Burger King also considers strategic issues linked to suppliers, consumers, new entrants, and substitutes. Competitors, customers, and substitutes are most significant in this Five Forces analysis of Burger King. The company’s strategies account for external factors in the quick-service restaurant industry. Competitive forces affect goals for pricing, profits, and industry leadership relating to Burger King’s vision and mission , which aim for customer satisfaction and higher business performance against other firms in the competitive environment in this Five Forces analysis case. Summary & Recommendations: Five Forces Analysis of Burger King Summary. Burger King’s competitive environment includes strategic issues. Using Porter’s Five Forces analysis, this case study of Burger King shows foodservice business external factors and the following force intensities: Competitive rivalry or competition: Strong force Bargaining power of buyers or customers: Strong force Bargaining power of suppliers: Weak force Threat of substitutes or substitution: Strong force Threat of new entrants or new entry: Moderate force Recommendations. Considering the intensities of the five forces, Burger King must focus on competition, customers, and substitutes. Based on this Five Forces analysis of Burger King, the following are recommended: To address the force of competition, Burger King’s marketing mix (4P) can implement more aggressive marketing strategies and tactics to gain more customers. This recommendation is a response to the aggressiveness of other restaurant chains that saturate the market covered in this Five Forces analysis. To attract and retain customers, Burger King can improve the quality of its food and beverage products through a multi-pronged approach. This recommended approach may include improved implementations of Burger King’s competitive strategy and growth strategies . Competitors, substitutes, and new entrants in this Five Forces analysis of the foodservice company are the targets of this recommendation. To counteract the threat of new entrants, a strategic approach is to improve the brand image and the other competitive advantages evaluated in the SWOT analysis of Burger King . Following this recommendation can maintain high business performance despite the saturation of the fast-food restaurant industry environment in this Five Forces analysis case. Competitive Rivalry or Competition with Burger King (Strong Force) Burger King competes with large multinational firms, as well as many small and medium-sized restaurant businesses. The degree of competition or competitive rivalry is examined in this aspect of Porter’s Five Forces analysis model. The following are the main external factors that create the strong force of competitive rivalry against Burger King: High number of foodservice companies (strong force) High variety of competitors (strong force) Consumers’ low switching costs (strong force) The target market is saturated with foodservice firms of different sizes, including McDonald’s , Subway , and Wendy’s , as well as coffeehouses, like Starbucks . These foodservice companies shape the competitive situation examined in this Five Forces analysis. Burger King must also consider the variety of firms in terms of types of products, market focus, and other characteristics. In addition, competitive rivalry is strong partly because of low switching costs, which correspond to customers’ high ease of transferring from Burger King to other firms. This aspect of the Five Forces analysis shows that competition is a main concern in Burger King’s business. Bargaining Power of Burger King’s Customers/Buyers (Strong Force) Consumers determine Burger King’s business performance and sales revenues, as well as the quick-service restaurant industry environment. This aspect of the Five Forces analysis explores the influence of customers on the company. External factors that lead to the strong bargaining power of Burger King’s customers are as follows: Consumers’ low switching costs (strong force) High availability of substitute food and drinks (strong force) Moderate presence of consumer organizations (moderate force) Consumers’ low switching costs correspond to the ease of transferring from Burger King to other companies. In Porter’s Five Forces analysis model, this external factor empowers customers to make decisions that directly affect the foodservice business. In addition, the many substitutes for Burger King’s products give consumers more choices. The presence of consumer organizations, such as Consumer Reports (Consumers Union) and Better Business Bureau, further increases the bargaining power of buyers. Consumer preferences and the external factors explored in the PESTLE/PESTEL analysis of Burger King influence the bargaining power of customers indicated in this Five Forces analysis. Bargaining Power of Burger King’s Suppliers (Weak Force) Suppliers affect the quick-service restaurant industry environment through pricing, supply control, and related variables. In this Five Forces analysis case, the following are the major external factors that create the weak bargaining power of Burger King’s suppliers: High number of suppliers (weak force) High overall supply (weak force) Suppliers’ low forward integration (weak force) There are many suppliers that compete to provide their products as business inputs for Burger King’s operations . Also, there is an abundance of supply of raw materials and ingredients used to produce and prepare the food and beverage items on the company’s menu. In this Five Forces analysis of Burger King, these conditions limit the influence of suppliers on the fast-food restaurant chain. Moreover, most suppliers in this industry have low forward integration, which corresponds to their weak control over the distribution and sale of their products to Burger King. Based on this aspect of the Five Forces analysis, the bargaining power of suppliers is not a major strategic concern for the foodservice business. Threat of Substitutes or Substitution against Burger King (Strong Force) Substitutes compete with Burger King’s products. This aspect of the Five Forces analysis determines the influence of substitution in the fast-food restaurant industry environment. In Burger King’s case, the following are the main external factors that contribute to the strong threat of substitution: Consumers’ low switching costs (strong force) High availability of substitute food and beverages (strong force) Satisfactory performance of substitutes (strong force) Customers can easily transfer from Burger King to substitutes (low switching costs). In addition, there are many substitutes to choose from, including fine-dining restaurants, ready-to-eat or microwavable meals, and home cooking. These conditi",

One tool that can help you analyse the competitive forces in your market is Porter’s Five Forces. Developed by Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter in the 1980s, Porter’s Five Forces is a framework used to evaluate the intensity of competition in an industry and the potential for profitability. By understanding the five forces, businesses can identify the key drivers of competition and make informed decisions about positioning themselves in the market. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll cover the basics of Porter’s Five Forces and how you can use them to analyse the competitive forces in your industry. By the end of this article, you’ll have a solid understanding of the five forces and how to use them to develop a winning business strategy. Threat Of New Entrants One of the forces that can affect the intensity of competition in an industry is the threat of new entrants. New entrants can disrupt existing competitors by offering new products or services, entering the market with lower prices, or utilising innovative business models. This can increase competition and pressure existing firms to adapt or lower their prices. Several factors can make it difficult for new entrants to enter and compete successfully with established firms. These include: High barriers to entry: Some industries have high barriers to entry that make it difficult for new firms to enter the market. These barriers include regulatory barriers, such as licensing requirements or strict regulations, and economic barriers, such as high upfront costs or the need for specialised equipment or technology. Strong brand recognition : Established firms often have strong brand recognition and loyalty among customers, making it difficult for new entrants to gain a foothold in the market. Economies of scale: Firms that have already achieved economies of scale – the cost advantages that come with producing at a large scale – may have a cost advantage over new entrants, making it difficult for new firms to compete on price. Threat Of Substitutes Another force to consider when analysing the intensity of competition in an industry is the threat of substitutes. Substitutes are products or services used in place of a particular product or service. For example, bottled water is a substitute for tap water, and streaming services are a substitute for cable television. The availability of substitutes can affect the demand for a particular product or service and pressure firms to lower their prices. Several factors can make it difficult for substitutes to enter the market: High switching costs: If customers face high costs to switch to a substitute product or service, such as purchasing new equipment or cancelling a subscription, they may be less likely to switch. Strong brand loyalty: If customers are loyal to a particular brand or product, they may be less likely to switch to a substitute. Bargaining Power Of Buyers The bargaining power of buyers, or the ability of customers to negotiate for lower prices or better terms, is another force to consider when evaluating the intensity of competition in an industry. If buyers have a lot of bargaining power, they can pressure firms to lower their prices or offer additional benefits to win their business. Several factors can give buyers more bargaining power: Availability of substitutes: If customers have several options, they may be more likely to negotiate for better terms or switch to a substitute product. Importance of the product to the buyer: If the product or service is essential to the buyer’s business or daily life, they may have more bargaining power. Number of buyers in the market: If there are many buyers in the market, firms may be more willing to negotiate to win their business. Bargaining Power Of Suppliers In addition to considering the bargaining power of buyers, businesses should also consider the bargaining power of suppliers. Suppliers can affect the prices and terms of the products or services they provide, and if they have a lot of bargaining power, they can pressure firms to pay higher prices or accept less favourable terms. Several factors can give suppliers more bargaining power: Availability of substitutes: If there are few substitutes for a supplier’s products or services, they may have more bargaining power. Importance of the supplier’s product to the buyer: If the supplier’s product is essential to the buyer’s business, the supplier may have more bargaining power. Concentration of suppliers in the market: If there are few suppliers in the market, they may have more bargaining power. Rivalry Among Existing Competitors The intensity of competition among existing competitors in an industry is another factor to consider when evaluating the potential for profitability. If there is a lot of rivalry among competitors, firms may be pressured to lower their prices, increase their marketing efforts, or introduce new products to stay competitive. There are several factors that can increase rivalry among existing competitors, including: Excess capacity: If there is more capacity in the market than in demand, firms may be more likely to compete aggressively to increase their market share. High fixed costs: If firms have high fixed costs, such as leasing a facility or purchasing equipment, they may be more likely to compete aggressively to recoup their costs. Intense price competition: If firms are competing primarily on price, they may be more likely to engage in price wars or other aggressive pricing strategies. Porter’s Five Forces In Online Retailing Threat of new entrants: The threat of new entrants in the online retailing industry is moderate. While the barriers to entry are relatively low – any individual or company can set up an e-commerce website with relatively little upfront investment – there are still some barriers to consider. For example, new entrants may face challenges in establishing a strong brand recognition and building a customer base and competing with established firms that already have economies of scale and strong customer loyalty. Threat of substitutes: The threat of substitutes in the online retailing industry is low. While customers can purchase products from physical stores or other online retailers, the convenience and wide selection of products offered by online retailers make them a strong choice for many customers. In addition, the high switching costs associated with changing online retailers – such as updating payment information and shipping addresses – may discourage customers from switching to substitutes. Bargaining power of buyers: The bargaining power of buyers in the online retailing industry is high. With the abundance of options available, customers can shop around and compare prices and negotiate for discounts or promotions. In addition, using price comparison websites and quickly checking prices on multiple sites gives buyers more bargaining power. Bargaining power of suppliers: The b",

It is especially useful when starting a new business or when entering a new industry sector. According to this framework, competitiveness does not only come from competitors. Rather, the state of competition in an industry depends on five basic forces: threat of new entrants, bargaining power of suppliers, bargaining power of buyers, threat of substitute products or services, and existing industry rivalry. The collective strength of these forces determines the profit potential of an industry and thus its attractiveness. If the five forces are intense (e.g. airline industry), almost no company in the industry earns attractive returns on investments. If the forces are mild however (e.g. softdrink industry), there is room for higher returns. Each force will be elaborated on below with the aid of examples from the airline industry to illustrate the usage. Figure 1: Five Forces Model Threat of new entrants New entrants in an industry bring new capacity and the desire to gain market share. The seriousness of the threat depends on the barriers to enter a certain industry. The higher these barriers to entry, the smaller the threat for existing players. Examples of barriers to entry are the need for economies of scale , high customer loyalty for existing brands, large capital requirements (e.g. large investments in marketing or R&D), the need for cumulative experience, government policies, and limited access to distribution channels. More barriers can be found in the table below. Example The threat of new entrants in the airline industry can be considered as low to medium. It takes quite some upfront investments to start an airline company (e.g. purchasing aircrafts). Moreover, new entrants need licenses, insurances, distribution channels and other qualifications that are not easy to obtain when you are new to the industry (e.g. access to flight routes). Furthermore, it can be expected that existing players have built up a large base of experience over the years to cut costs and increase service levels.  A new entrant is likely to not have this kind of expertise, therefore creating a competitive disadvantage right from the start. However, due to the liberalization of market access and the availability of leasing options and external finance from banks, investors, and aircraft manufacturers, new doors are opening for potential entrants. Even though it doesn’t sound very attractive for companies to enter the airline industry, it is NOT impossible. Many low-cost carriers like Southwest Airlines, RyanAir and EasyJet have successfully entered the industry over the years by introducing innovative cost-cutting business models, thereby shaking up original players like American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and KLM. Porter’s Five Forces Video Tutorial Bargaining power of suppliers This force analyzes how much power and control a company’s supplier (also known as the market of inputs) has over the potential to raise its prices or to reduce the quality of purchased goods or services, which in turn would lower an industry’s profitability potential. The concentration of suppliers and the availability of substitute suppliers are important factors in determining supplier power. The fewer there are, the more power they have. Businesses are in a better position when there are a multitude of suppliers. Sources of supplier power also include the switching costs of companies in the industry, the presence of available substitutes, the strength of their distribution channels and the uniqueness or level of differentiation in the product or service the supplier is delivering. Example The bargaining power of suppliers in the airline industry can be considered very high. When looking at the major inputs that airline companies need, we see that they are especially dependent on fuel and aircrafts. These inputs however are very much affected by the external environment over which the airline companies themselves have little control. The price of aviation fuel is subject to the fluctuations in the global market for oil, which can change wildly because of geopolitical and other factors. In terms of aircrafts for example, only two major suppliers exist: Boeing and Airbus. Boeing and Airbus therefore have substantial bargaining power on the prices they charge. Bargaining power of buyers The bargaining power of buyers is also described as the market of outputs. This force analyzes to what extent the customers are able to put the company under pressure, which also affects the customer’s sensitivity to price changes. The customers have a lot of power when there aren’t many of them and when the customers have many alternatives to buy from. Moreover, it should be easy for them to switch from one company to another. Buying power is low however when customers purchase products in small amounts, act independently and when the seller’s product is very different from any of its competitors. The internet has allowed customers to become more informed and therefore more empowered. Customers can easily compare prices online, get information about a wide variety of products and get access to offers from other companies instantly. Companies can take measures to reduce buyer power by for example implementing loyalty programs or by differentiating their products and services. Example Bargaining power of buyers in the airline industry is high. Customers are able to check prices of different airline companies fast through the many online price comparisons websites such as Skyscanner and Expedia. In addition, there aren’t any switching costs involved in the process. Customers nowadays are likely to fly with different carriers to and from their destination if that would lower the costs. Brand loyalty therefore doesn’t seem to be that high. Some airline companies are trying to change this with frequent flyer programs aimed at rewarding customers that come back to them from time to time. Threat of substitute products The existence of products outside of the realm of the common product boundaries increases the propensity of customers to switch to alternatives. In order to discover these alternatives one should look beyond similar products that are branded differently by competitors. Instead, every product that serves a similar need for customers should be taken into account. Energy drink like Redbull for instance is usually not considered a competitor of coffee brands such as Nespresso or Starbucks. However, since both coffee and energy drink fulfill a similar need (i.e. staying awake/getting energy), customers might be willing to switch from one to another if they feel that prices increase too much in either coffee or energy drinks. This will ultimately affect an industry’s profitability and should therefore also be taken into account when evaluating the industry’s attractiveness. Example In terms of the airline industry, it can be said that the general need of its customers is traveling. It ma",

Martin, 2021 A client recently asked me how I think through a situation in which entirely new competitors enter an existing market — not tiny little upstarts but big established firms whose primary businesses are in different industries. It is a good strategy question, so I decided to write my 9th Year II Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) piece on Competing Against Big New Entrants: Beat ’em, Join ’em, or Exit Stage Left? You can find all previous PTW/PI here . The Strategy Question An extremely popular question, ever since the great Clay Christensen’s best-seller The Innovator’s Dilemma , is how a leading player in an industry should think about/deal with upstart entrants into their industry. I don’t want to add to the mountain of writing on that subject. Rather, I will address the less discussed question of what to do when a giant — as big as or bigger than you — migrates from its own traditional industry into yours? While it might not happen as frequently as upstart entry, it does happen and is strategically tricky for the incumbent. Thinking it Through The tool I use for this circumstance is the same one I use whenever I think about a competitor — the Strategy Choice Cascade pictured above. While people may think that the Cascade is a tool for your own strategy — and it is — it is also the best way to understand the strategies of your competitors. Start by reverse-engineering their Where-to-Play (WTP) and How-to-Win (HTW) choices — those are pretty obviousto a thoughtful external observer from their observable actions . Then make educated guesses as to their Winning Aspiration (WA), Must-Have Capabilities (MHC), and Enabling Management Systems (EMS). When you understand a competitor’s WA/WTP/HTW/MHC/EMS, you can think through how your Cascade needs to be uniquely different than theirs in order to win in a distinctive fashion. As I have argued previously , there can be multiple ways for competitors to win in adjacent and/or partially overlapping spaces. But you have to understand the Choice Cascades of your competitors to pick that optimal place to play and corresponding way to continue winning. So, when an established company shifts its strategy to overlap with yours in a way that it didn’t previously, the automatic strategy reaction should be to reverse-engineer its new strategy to gain the insights necessary to determine how to respond. Winning Aspiration What was Google’s WA when it entered the smartphone market in 2007 against the established competitors — led at the time by Research in Motion? It was not to make a buck in smartphones. Google gave its Android operating system away for free. Instead, it wanted more customers to enter the Google online universe of Gmail, Chrome and the Google Play Store because their phone ran on Android. And it had the knock-on effect of helping Samsung, already a highly capable consumer electronics giant, gain the one thing it was missing for successful competition in smartphones, which was operating software development. So, the established competitors (including Apple who entered contemporaneously) needed to understand that Google/Android could not be repelled from the smartphone market because it wasn’t trying to make a (direct) profit, and that Samsung would be a huge force in the industry because it got for free the one missing piece in its endowment of MHC. Where-to-Play When MCI entered the US long distance telephony market against AT&T, its WTP was much narrower than that of AT&T, the previous monopolist. AT&T played absolutely everywhere — all customers in all geographies. MCI targeted the dense, high-volume customer and geographic segments for which the costs-to-serve were considerably lower. MCI didn’t worry about customers in rural Wyoming or businesses outside large metro areas — while AT&T served them all, with the attendant higher costs. And worse still, AT&T cross-subsidized customers, overcharging the dense routes and high-volume customers while subsidizing the sparse routes and low-volume customers. Slowly but surely, AT&T’s economics worsened as the most attractive customers defected until such time as it was acquired by SBC at a fraction of its peak worth. To survive, AT&T would have needed to respond to MCI’s narrower WTP choice. When giant Apple entered the MP3 player market in 2001 against the incumbents including the first portable digital audio player, MPMan, it chose a broader WTP. It didn’t just sell a MP3 player, it provided users with the combination of the iPod with the music downloading service iTunes. It was a broader WTP that enabled a compelling HTW — which enabled iPod to dominate the space. How-to-Win When Progressive Insurance took on the established giants (e.g., Allstate, State Farm) in non-standard auto insurance, it decided to win by making its profits on insurance, not on investment income and that enabled it to win with non-standard drivers by paying out claims quickly and without customer hassle because Progressive’s strategy didn’t call for delaying claim payments for as long as possible to keep earning investment income. The incumbents didn’t want to change their business models, which enabled Progressive to become the leader in non-standard auto insurance. Red Hat decided that rather than attempting to make money by selling disks containing its compilation of Linux software, as did all the other Linux players in the mid-1990s, it would make money on selling services. That caused it to allow its software to be downloaded free from the Internet, which built its market share to the dominant in the industry, making it the most attractive service provider. The other incumbents didn’t have any response to this new HTW and allowed Red Hat to dominate the space and build a business that it later sold to IBM for $34 billion. Must-Have Capabilities When Apple entered the smartphone business in 2007, it brought a suite of webpage rendering capabilities to the business from its long experience in PCs that made its iPhone a superior web access device versus the incumbents and the new Android-based entrants. Those capabilities, plus the experience with operating the iTunes business which gave it a leg up on developing its App Store, helped it make the iPhone the most profitable player in the rapidly growing smartphone space. Loblaws became the dominant grocer in Canada, penetrating markets outside its home of Ontario by owning its own real estate, not leasing it, which enabled it to offer whatever selection of goods and services it wished and not be constrained as were its competitors by leases with non-compete clauses in the developments in which they operated. Enabling Management Systems When Amazon famously entered the book selling business against the entrenched incumbents, it had a management system that captured and used buyer data to build the capability for providing recommendations of other books that its existing buyers were likely to enjoy. In due course, the incumbents responded by building management systems and capabilities, but their efforts were far too little, far too late. Making an Assessment Reverse-engineering the strategy of the entrant will enable you, as the incumbent, to assess the magnitude and form of the threat. And that assessment will facilitate you making one of three fundamental strategy choices in response. The first choice is to up your game on your current strategy. The beloved Canadian retailer, Canadian Tire, is considered one of very few competitive retailers that has fared well in the face of major entry into its market by Walmart.

Full bio Learn about our editorial policy Updated Sep 9, 2022 Threat of New Entrants: Get to Know One of Porter’s Five Forces Table of Contents Porter’s Five Forces What is the Threat of New Entrants? Barriers to Entry Threat of New Entrants Analysis Success is Not Guaranteed How competitive is your industry? As you look to keep your business growing, you’ll likely be aware of your competitors and what they bring to the table. After all, you’re trying to attract the same type of customers. At the same time, you have to be on the lookout for new companies looking to enter your industry. But how do you measure the competitiveness of your market? Many experts do this through an industrial analysis framework called Porter’s Five Forces. Through this framework, you can get a more accurate picture of the rivalry among existing competitors and what the potential threat of new entrants might be. You can also use it to see which industry will give you the best chance of success for your company. Read on to learn about Porter’s Five Forces, what the threat of new entrants is, some of the common barriers to entry, and how to compare these different factors. Porter’s Five Forces First developed by Harvard University professor Michael Porter, Porter’s Five Forces present a framework that helps company leaders analyze the level of competition within an industry. The threat of new entrants is one of these forces, but the others also play significant roles in determining how competitive specific industries can be. These other forces include the bargaining power of suppliers, bargaining power of buyers, the threat of substitutes or threat of substitute products, and competitive rivalry. What is the Threat of New Entrants? As part of Porter’s Five Forces, the threat of new entrants refers to how threatening a new competitor might be to companies that already have a place in their respective industries. That includes how easy it is for new companies to enter the industry in the first place. If the threat is high for an industry, it likely means new competitors show up frequently and gain traction without much difficulty. If the threat is low, industries will likely see few new competitors. Even when new companies do enter the market, they will find success harder to achieve. Barriers to Entry When analyzing the threat of new entrants, you must look at the barriers to entry for an industry. These barriers represent the obstacles people at a new company must overcome to get their business off the ground. The following are the most common barriers to entry new competitors face. 1. Brand Loyalty Existing companies may have brand loyalty among customers. In other words, their customers have a sense of loyalty that ties them to a particular company that makes them want to buy their product or service. Brand loyalty can be a driving force for customer decisions. New entrants in an industry that already features high brand loyalty may find it challenging to get customers in that field to pay attention to them. Take the video game console market, for example. The leading players in that market are Nintendo, Sony PlayStation, and Microsoft Xbox. Each brand has its devoted and passionate fans, making it difficult for new entrants to gain traction. The list of failed video game consoles is long, even though it features names known for their success in other industries, like Philips and Nokia. 2. Technology Access To compete in some industries, companies need to have access to some of the latest technology. This access represents another barrier to entry since not just any company can use breakthrough technologies to compete. Take the telecommunications industry as an example. To compete there, you would need the same type of technology businesses like Verizon and AT&T have, requiring substantial investments that would eat into profits. As such, it’s challenging to get a new company up and running in that environment. 3. Government Policies Another barrier to entry is the government policies that have an impact on specific industries. If a company has to go through piles of red tape, it is much more challenging to get started. Many sectors have numerous rules and regulations they have to handle, which impose obstacles on new companies. The pharmaceutical industry is one such area featuring heavy regulations and legal standards. New competitors may shy away from the industry altogether with so much to contend with regarding legal requirements. 4. Economies of Scale Economies of scale represent significant cost advantages of organizations that have already been established. The large size of companies with economies of scale gives them an edge since it costs less to make a product or offer a service. New companies don’t have that advantage and need to start from scratch. An example of economies of scale comes from parcel companies like FedEx and DHL. Since they already provide a vast network of delivery services, their costs are relatively low. A new competitor would have much higher costs to start out, which is why you see so few new companies in that industry and a decreased threat of new entrants. 5. Distribution Channels In addition to economies of scale, another barrier to entry includes access to distribution channels and suppliers. Some companies already have a distribution network they use regularly. Some also have exclusive access to suppliers. These aspects make it difficult for new companies to get started. Think of the advantages major retail stores like Walmart have when it comes to supply and distribution. That network took decades to build up, giving them an edge over the competition. For newcomers to the retail industry, they must work from a less advantageous position. 6. Initial Capital Another barrier to entry is the initial capital needed to start a business. In some industries, including those with high profit potential, the capital company owners need can be enormous. While most small businesses have startup costs of 25,000 dollars or less, the initial capital for some areas can be as high as three million dollars. With such a number, new companies rarely enter the market. As a result, the threat of new entrants is low. One field where this is the case would be the oil and gas industry, which features high expenses for equipment and technology to get the ball rolling. You can calculate your startup costs by going to this handy guide from the U.S. Small Business Administration . 7. Switching Costs Another obstacle new entrants face is called switching costs. These costs are what consumers pay when changing the brand they usually use. Areas with high switching costs will feature a low threat of new entrants because consumers will be less likely to change their buying habits by choosing a new brand. Switching costs come in forms outside the monetary kind, such as the amount of effort needed or the psychological costs. An example of a low switching cost would be going from one soft drink to a different one. A high switching cost would be a brand of software a company uses since changing would require purchasing new software, integrating it with work processes, training workers how to use it, and more.

When responding to the questions below, consider the main market the business plans to launch in. Please maintain the boundaries of this market in the responses. The average score, minimum score, and maximum score will be automatically calculated based on the numbers input in each field. 1. Market Competitiveness This refers to how competitive and profitable a market is. The more competitive a market, the lower the profit opportunity becomes. Consider how competitive the industry is for the business or project to sell to customers. This includes the number of competitors in the industry, the presence of substitute products or services, and the power of customers to influence business. Rank the main market on each of the criteria below, from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). Market saturation: Number of competitors. Market diversity : Diversity of competition. Industry concentration : Concentration ratio of an industry. Industry growth : Pace of growth of an industry. Quality differences: Key differences between companies. Brand loyalty: How loyal customers are. Barriers to exit : Companies can only stay within this market. Switching costs : The cost to switch if a buyer is dissatisfied. 2. Bargaining Power of Buyers This refers to how much impact customers have on pricing structures. The more power a buyer has to demand lower prices or higher quality, the lower the profit opportunity becomes. Detail the level of impact customers have on the business or projected if they choose to switch to other providers. The level of power customers hold depends on the industry, for instance, few buyers and numerous sellers gives the customer greater influence. Rank the main market on each of the criteria below, from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). Buyer concentration : Number of customers. Size of each customer : Number of orders per buyer. Differences between competitors: How different competitors are from one another. Price sensitivity : Buyers sensitive to changes in price. Available substitutes : Number of alternatives or substitutes available. Buyer’s information availability : Buyer ability to gather information about companies. Switching costs : The cost to switch if a buyer is dissatisfied. Finally, in the box add any other information applicable to Bargaining Power of Buyers. 3. Threat of Substitution This refers to how much control a supplier has over the existing market. The more power a supplier has to sell their goods at a higher cost or offer lower quality items, the lower the profit opportunity becomes. Consider the availability of substitute products or services in the industry, and how likely customers are to purchase these products or services instead of yours. An availability of viable substitutes could impact the kinds of prices that customers are willing to pay, for example. Rank the main market on each of the criteria below, from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). Available substitutes : Number of alternatives or substitutes available. Buyer propensity to substitute : Likelihood of buyer finding a substitute. Relative price performance of substitute : Price of substitutes in comparison. Perceived level of differentiation : Buyer understanding of quality differences. Switching costs : The cost to switch if a buyer is dissatisfied. Finally, in the box add any other information applicable to Threat of Substitution. 4. Threat of New Entrants This refers to opportunities where customers can easily substitute one product/service for another if they choose to do so. The easier it is for customers to substitute, the more competitive the market becomes. Discuss how likely it is for new competitors to enter the market, and the level of impact new entrants would have on the business. Consider how much competition already exists in your industry, and the kinds of entry barriers that new competitors face. Rank the main market on each of the criteria below, from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). Barriers to entry : Number of barriers to entry. Economies of scale : Number of large companies with high quantity output, low costs. Brand loyalty : How loyal customers are. Capital requirements : Need for large capital investments. Cumulative experience : How advanced and experienced is the market. Government policies : Regulatory requirements that may affect new entrants. Access to distribution channels : Strength of existing distribution channel relationships. Switching costs : The cost to switch if a buyer is dissatisfied. Finally, in the box add any other information applicable to the Threat of New Entrants. 5. Bargaining Power of Suppliers This refers to the ease of entering the market. The easier it is for other organisations to enter, the more competitive the market becomes. Detail the level of power held by suppliers in your business or project’s industry. Consider what level the business and its competitors rely on key suppliers, and whether could certain actions by these suppliers impact business operations. Rank the main market on each of the criteria below, from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). Quantity of suppliers : Number of suppliers. Capacity of suppliers : Specific expertise or technology needed from suppliers. Supplier specialness : No other suppliers available. Contractual conditions : Any obligations to remain with suppliers. Switching costs : The cost to switch if a supplier is dissatisfied. Finally, in the box add any other information applicable to Bargaining Power of Suppliers. Click ‘Save’ to save.

First described by Michael Porter in his classic 1979 Harvard Business Review article, Porter’s insights started a revolution in the strategy field and continue\n            to shape business practice and academic thinking today. \n            \t\t\t\t\t\tA Five Forces analysis can help companies assess industry attractiveness, how\n            trends will affect industry competition, which industries a company should compete\n            in—and how companies can position themselves for success. Threat of New Entrants The threat of new entrants into an industry can force current players to keep\n            prices down and spend more to retain customers. Actually, entry brings new capacity\n            and pressure on prices and costs. \n            \t\t\t\t\t\tThe threat of entry, therefore, puts a cap on the profit potential of an industry.\n            \n            \t\t\t\t\t\tThis threat depends on the size of a series of barriers to entry, including\n            economies of scale, to the cost of building brand awareness, to accessing distribution\n            channels, to government restrictions. The threat of entry also depends on the capabilities of the likely potential\n            entrants. \n            \t\t\t\t\t\tIf there are well established companies in the industry operating in other geographic\n            regions, for example, the threat of entry rises. Bargaining Power of Suppliers Companies in every industry purchase various inputs from suppliers, which account\n            for differing proportions of cost. Powerful suppliers can use their negotiating leverage\n            to charge higher prices or demand more favorable terms from industry competitors,\n            which lowers industry profitability. \n            \t\t\t\t\t\tIf there are only one or two suppliers of an essential input product, for example,\n            or if switching suppliers is expensive or time consuming, a supplier group wields\n            more power. Bargaining Power of Buyers Powerful customers can use their clout to force prices down or demand more service\n            at existing prices, thus capturing more value for themselves. Buyer power is highest\n            when buyers are large relative to the competitors serving them, \n            \t\t\t\t\t\tproducts are undifferentiated and represent a significant cost for the buyer,\n            and there are few switching costs to shifting business from one competitor to another.\n            \n            \t\t\t\t\t\tThey can play rivals against each other—especially if an industry’s products\n            are undifferentiated, it’s inexpensive to switch loyalties, and price trumps quality. There may be multiple buyer segments in a given industry with different levels\n            of power. Threat of Substitute Products or Services A substitute is another product or service that meets the same underlying need\n            that the industry’s product meets in a different way. Videoconferencing is a substitute\n            for travel. Email is a substitute for express mail. The threat of a substitute is high if it offers an attractive price-performance\n            trade-off versus the industry’s product, especially if the buyer’s cost of switching\n            to the substitute is low. Rivalry Among Existing Competitors If rivalry is intense, it drives down prices or dissipates profits by raising\n            the cost of competing. Companies compete away the value they create. \n            \t\t\t\t\t\tRivalry tends to be especially fierce if: Competitors are numerous or are roughly equal in size and market position Industry growth is slow There are high fixed costs, which create incentives for price cutting Exit barriers are high Rivals are highly committed to the business Firms have differing goals, diverse approaches to competing, or lack familiarity with\n                     one another First described by Michael Porter in his classic 1979 Harvard Business Review article, Porter’s insights started a revolution in the strategy field, and continue\n            to shape business practice and academic thinking.\n            \t\t\t\t\t\tA Five Forces analysis can help companies assess which industries to compete\n            in—and how to position themselves for success. Key Industry Structure Concepts Every industry is different, but the underlying drivers of profitably are the same in every industry. Share This: The Five Forces determine the competitive structure of an industry, and its profitability. Industry structure, together with a company's relative position within the industry, are the two basic drivers of company profitability. Share This: Analyzing the Five Forces can help companies anticipate shifts in competition, shape how industry structure evolves, and find better strategic positions within the industry. Share This: How the Five Forces Work Read full analysis on International Air Transport Association Vision 2050 Industry Structure is Dynamic Industry structure changes over time, and is not static. Over time, buyers or suppliers can become more or less powerful. Technological or managerial innovations can make new entry or substitution more or less likely. Changes in regulation can change the intensity of rivalry, or affect barriers to entry. Choices by competition, such as new pricing or distribution approaches, can also affect the path of industry competition. Five Forces analysis is essential to anticipate and exploit industry structural change.

Share Understanding Porter's Five Forces Porter's Five Forces is a business analysis model that helps to explain why various industries are able to sustain different levels of profitability. The model was published in Michael E. Porter's book, \"Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors\" in 1980.1 ﻿ The Five Forces model is widely used to analyze the industry structure of a company as well as its corporate strategy. Porter identified five undeniable forces that play a part in shaping every market and industry in the world,with some caveats. The five forces are frequently used to measure competition intensity, attractiveness, and profitability of an industry or market. The threat of New Entry. Your position can be affected by people’s ability to enter your market. So, think about how easily this could be done. The threat of Substitution. This refers to the likelihood of your customers finding a different way of doing what you do. Supplier Power. This is determined by how easy it is for your suppliers to increase their prices. Buyer Power. How easy it is for buyers to drive your prices down. Competitive Rivalry: This looks at the number and strength of your competitors. By thinking about how each force affects you, and by identifying its strength and direction, you can quickly assess your product position in the market. You can then look at what strategic changes you need to make to deliver long-term profit. 1) Threat of new entrants New entrants put pressure on current organizations within an industry through their desire to gain market share. This in turn puts pressure on prices, costs, and the rate of investment needed to sustain a business within the industry. The threat of new entrants is particularly intense if they are diversifying from another market as they can leverage existing expertise, cash flow, and brand identity as it puts a strain on existing companies' profitability. Barriers to entry restrict the threat of new entrants. If the barriers are high, the threat of new entrants is reduced and conversely if the barriers are low, the risk of new companies venturing into a given market is high. Barriers to entry are advantages that existing, established companies have over new entrants. Michael E. Porter differentiates two factors which can have an effect on how much of a threat new entrants may pose: Barriers to entry The most attractive segment is one in which entry barriers are high and exit barriers are low. It is worth noting, however, that high barriers to entry almost always make exit more difficult.Michael E. Porter lists 7 major sources of entry barriers: Supply-side economies of scale – spreading the fixed costs over a larger volume of units thus reducing the cost per unit. This can discourage a new entrant because they either have to start trading at a smaller volume of unit and accept a price disadvantage over larger companies, or risk coming into the market on a large scale in an attempt to displace the existing market leader. Demand-side benefits of scale – this occurs when a buyers willingness to purchase a particular product or service increases with other people's willingness to purchase it. Also known as network effect, people tend to value being in a 'network' with a larger number of people who use the same company. Customer switching costs – These are well illustrated by structural market characteristics such as supply chain integration but also can be created by firms. Airline frequent flyer programs are an example. Capital requirements – clearly the Internet has influenced this factor dramatically. Websites and apps can be launched cheaply and easily as opposed to the brick-and-mortar industries of the past. Incumbency advantages independent of size (e.g., customer loyalty and brand equity ). Unequal access to distribution channels – if there are a limited number of distribution channels for a certain product/service, new entrants may struggle to find a retail or wholesale channel to sell through as existing competitors will have a claim on them. Government policy such as sanctioned monopolies, legal franchise requirements, patents, and regulatory requirements. 2) Threat of substitutes A substitute product uses a different technology to try to solve the same economic need. Examples of substitutes are meat, poultry, and fish; landlines and cellular telephones; airlines, automobiles, trains, and ships; beer and wine; and so on. For example, tap water is a substitute for Coke, but Pepsi is a product that uses the same technology (albeit different ingredients) to compete head-to-head with Coke, so it is not a substitute. Increased marketing for drinking tap water might \"shrink the pie\" for both Coke and Pepsi, whereas increased Pepsi advertising would likely \"grow the pie\" (increase consumption of all soft drinks), while giving Pepsi a larger market share at Coke's expense. Potential factors: Buyer propensity to substitute. This aspect incorporated both tangible and intangible factors. Brand loyalty can be very important as in the Coke and Pepsi example above; however contractual and legal barriers are also effective. Relative price performance of substitute Buyer's switching costs. This factor is well illustrated by the mobility industry. Uber and its many competitors took advantage of the incumbent taxi industry's dependence on legal barriers to entry and when those fell away, it was trivial for customers to switch. There were no costs as every transaction was atomic, with no incentive for customers not to try another product. Perceived level of product differentiation which is classic Michael Porter in the sense that there are only two basic mechanisms for competition – lowest price or differentiation. Developing multiple products for niche markets is one way to mitigate this factor. Number of substitute products available in the market Ease of substitution 3) Bargaining power of customers The bargaining power of customers is also described as the market of outputs: the ability of customers to put the firm under pressure, which also affects the customer's sensitivity to price changes. Firms can take measures to reduce buyer power, such as implementing a loyalty program. Buyers' power is high if buyers have many alternatives. It is low if they have few choices. Potential factors: Buyer concentration to firm concentration ratio Degree of dependency upon existing channels of distribution Bargaining leverage , particularly in industries with high fixed costs Buyer switching costs Buyer information availability Availability of existing substitute products Buyer price sensitivity Differential advantage (uniqueness) of industry products RFM (customer value) Analysis 4) Bargaining power of suppliers The bargaining power of suppliers is also described as the market of inputs. Suppliers of raw materials, components, labor, and services (such as expertise) to the firm can be a source of power over the firm when there are few substitutes. If you are making biscuits and there is only one person who sells flour, you have no alternative but to buy it from them. Suppliers may refuse to work with the firm or charge excessively high prices for unique resources. Potential factors are: Supplier switching costs relative to firm swit",
