Substitution can occur between products, services, technologies, and activities. Inferior goods are those that are substituted for superior goods when income decreases. Complementary goods have correlated demand and tend to be purchased together, such as toys and batteries or books and coffee.

When two or more products are considered substitutes, it means that they serve a similar purpose or function and can be used interchangeably to some extent. If the price of one of these substitute products increases, consumers may switch to purchasing the other substitute product, assuming that its price remains stable or decreases. Substitute products can be classified into two main categories: Perfect Substitutes: Perfect substitutes are products that are nearly identical in terms of their utility or ability to satisfy a particular need or want. Consumers view these products as completely interchangeable. For example, two brands of bottled water with the same quality and price would be considered perfect substitutes. Imperfect Substitutes: Imperfect substitutes are products that are similar but not identical. Consumers may have a preference for one over the other based on factors such as quality, brand, features, or price. For instance, margarine and butter can be considered imperfect substitutes because they both serve as spreads but have different flavors and characteristics. The concept of substitute products is important in understanding consumer behavior and market dynamics. When analyzing the demand for a particular product, economists often consider the availability of substitute products, as changes in their prices or attributes can impact consumers' choices and affect the demand for the original product. Additionally, businesses may consider substitute products when making pricing and marketing decisions to remain competitive in the market.

The threat of substitutes is the availability of other products that a customer could purchase from outside an industry. The competitive structure of an industry is threatened when there are substitute products available that offer a reasonably close benefits match at a competitive price. In this case, price points are limited by the prices at which substitutes are available, thereby limiting the amount of profitability that can be generated within an industry. When there is a strong threat of substitutes, industry players must pay more attention to operating in the most efficient manner possible; otherwise, their high cost structures will interfere with profitability and may drive some firms out of business. When there is a reduced threat of substitutes, industry players tend to be more lax with their cost controls , resulting in higher prices charged to customers. Because there is little prospect of competition from outside the industry, there is a higher potential for profits within the industry. Thus, firms tend to generate higher profits at the expense of their customers. Related AccountingTools Course Business Strategy What Causes a Higher Threat of Substitutes? The following factors cause a higher threat of substitutes for an industry: Customers can easily switch between products. Substitute products are readily available to customers. Substitute products have better features than comparable products within the industry. Substitute products have higher quality/reliability than comparable products within the industry. Substitute products have lower costs than comparable products within the industry. Example of the Threat of Substitutes As an example of the threat of substitutes, a variety of online streaming platforms were able to substitute for the offerings of the traditional cable and satellite television companies. In this situation, customers were looking for entertainment and on-demand access to TV shows and movies. The streaming companies were able to meet this need at a lower cost, and provide it to consumers anytime, anywhere, and on different devices. Users were also able to choose subscriptions tailored to their preferences, and could view exclusive, high-quality content that was not available on traditional cable channels. The result of these substitutes was widespread cancellation of cable subscriptions in favor of streaming, resulting in a sharp drop in revenues for the cable companies. Many cable providers launched their own streaming services to remain competitive. This example highlights how substitutes can disrupt an entire industry, forcing existing players to innovate, diversify, or risk losing their market share. How to Reduce the Threat of Substitutes There are a number of ways in which a company can mitigate the threat of substitutes. For example, it can inspire brand loyalty through its marketing efforts, product quality, and support services. Or, it can focus intently on specific market niches, so that the value it offers to customers within those niches exceeds the value that customers can obtain from substitutes. Another possibility is to identify those customers who are most likely to shift to substitutes, and target them for enhanced service and marketing efforts, so that they are aware of the particular value that the organization brings to them. Yet another possibility is to lock in customers with systems that are specific to the company - such as by not using industry-standard specifications that would allow customers to easily swap in competing products. Investment Interpretation of the Threat of Substitutes From the perspective of an investment analysis, an industry is a better prospect for investment when the threat of substitutes is low, since firms within the industry have a higher potential to earn an above-average profit. An investor would want to watch for increases in the threat over time, since changes in this direction could lead to a decline of profitability within an industry, and therefore a decline in the value of the shares of businesses in that industry.

Substitutes or substitute goods refer to the products that are used as alternatives to each other. These are alternatively demanded goods that satisfy the same need or want. In simple words, a substitute good is a product or service that is used in place of another. Examples For example, if a person does not like the taste of coffee or the price of coffee is high, the person might use tea as an alternative; hence, tea and coffee are substitutes. Some other examples of substitute goods are Pepsi and Coca-Cola, tooth paste and tooth powder, ink and ball pens, butter and margarine, an Android phone, and an Apple iphone. Graphs Let's consider two substitutes: Pepsi and Coca-Cola. The economic relationship between the price of Pepsi and the quantity demanded of Coke is positive. This relationship is illustrated by using the following graphs: The graphs illustrating the economic relationship between two substitutes: Pepsi and Coca-Cola. In the above diagram, we have two graphs comparing two substitute goods. In the left graph, we have the market for Pepsi Cola, and the initial equilibrium is at E0. In this scenario, if the supply of Pepsi is increased from S 0 to S 1 , the price decreases from P 0 to P 1 , and there will be high demand for Pepsi as the quantity demanded will increase from Q 0 to Q 1 . The demand curve shows the increase in the quantity demanded of Pepsi with a decreasing price. In the right graph, we have the market for Coca-Cola. In this scenario, there is a leftward shift of demand for Coca-Cola (substitute) from D 0 to D 1 due to a fall in the price of Pepsi. The price of Coca-Cola decreased from P 0 to P1, and the quantity traded also decreased from Q 0 to Q 1 . In this situation, Pepsi is used as an alternative or substitute for Coca-Cola, and people are using more Pepsi because it becomes a cheaper alternative to Coca-Cola. Cross-Elasticity of Demand The degree of responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good to the change in the price of another good alone is called Cross Elasticity of demand (XED). XED is calculated by using the following formula: XED = % Change in Qd of Product A / % Change in Price of Product B An image containing the formula of cross elasticity of demand. In economics, the relationship between any two goods can be explained by using the concept of cross elasticity of demand (XED) or cross-price elasticity of demand. In substitute economics, the cross-elasticity of demand is always positive. This explains why, when the price of one product increases, the demand for another product or substitute product increases because customers are more likely to prefer affordable goods or services. Here are some important points: A positive cross-elasticity of demand means that the goods are substitutes. A negative cross-elasticity of demand means that the goods are complements. A zero cross-elasticity of demand means that the goods are unrelated goods. XED Example Let’s take tea and coffee as substitutes and calculate XED as an example. Suppose that a 10% price increase for tea leads to a 30% rise in the demand for coffee. In this case, XED = +30%/+10% = +3 This positive cross-price elasticity of demand indicated that tea and coffee are substitutes. Strength of Substitutes The numerical value of XED with a positive sign shows the strength of substitutes. A lower positive cross elasticity of demand means weak substitutes while a higher positive value means strong or close substitutes. Types of Substitute Goods The following are some types of substitute goods, which are explained below: Brand Substitutes Brand substitutes are products from different brands that are used for similar purposes. For example, soft drinks such as Canon and Nikon digital cameras. Both are used for photography and videography and are known brands in the marketplace. Generic Substitutes Generic substitutes are unbranded products that are similar to a well-known brand. For example, generic ibuprofen rather than a specific brand like Advil. Close Substitutes Close substitutes are products that bear a close resemblance in terms of features, functionality, price, etc. For example, some smartphones have similar features and can be considered as close substitutes. Perfect Substitutes Perfect substitutes are products that are totally identical to each other in terms of features and functionality. Imperfect Substitutes Imperfect substitutes are products that are similar but not identical to other alternative brands. For example, brands for sneakers, makeup, coffee, etc. Within Category Substitutes Within-category substitutes are products that are related to the same category or industry of goods and can also be used as substitutes for each other. Different car models and brands for soda are examples of within-category substitutes. Cross Category Substitutes Cross-category substitutes are products that belong to different categories or industries but can also be used as alternatives for the same purpose. For example, an increase in the price of a movie ticket can lead to increased demand for online movie streaming platforms. Perfect Substitutes vs. Less Perfect Substitutes The following table contains the main features of perfect substitutes and less perfect substitutes. An image of a table containing the main features of perfect substitutes and less perfect substitutes. Substitute Goods vs. Complementary Goods Substitute goods (substitutes) are alternatively demanded goods, while complementary goods (complements) are jointly demanded goods. A complementary good is a good that adds value to another, or, a good that cannot be used without each other. Some examples of complementary products are, tooth paste and tooth brush, car and petrol, pen and ink, computer and hard disk, mobile and battery. The following table contains the main points of difference between substitute goods and complementary goods . An image of a table containing the main points of difference between substitute goods and complementary goods. Market Effects on Substitute Products The following points explain the market effects on the substitute products: Price Competition In a market with many substitute products, competition among them can drive down prices as they try to attract customers. Innovation and Differentiation To stand out in a crowded market, substitute products may innovate or differentiate themselves to offer unique features or benefits to consumers. Market Saturation If a market becomes saturated with substitute products, it can lead to intense competition and potentially lower profit margins for manufacturers and sellers. Market Dynamics Changes in market conditions, such as shifts in consumer demand or the introduction of new technologies, can impact the popularity and demand for substitute products. Impact of Substitute Products The following are some impacts of substitute products: Increased Competition Substitute products cause an increase in competition because the availability of substitute products can lead to lower prices for products or services. This competition can lead to better-quality products because companies have to retain their customers and attract them to increase demand for their products. Price Sensitivity Pri",

In a survey conducted by Kaufman, Hall and Associates, 71% of health systems reported distribution delays; 58% surveyed reported raw product and sourcing availability disruptions. 1 ECRI included supply chain disruptions in its annual Top 10 Patient Safety Concerns in 2021 and 2022. While supply chain challenges are anticipated to remain, nonacute care facility leaders can implement proactive strategies to achieve supply chain resilience and avoid disrupting or delaying necessary patient care. Substituting Products: A Strategy That Works Identifying substitute products in advance is one way to ensure a more flexible supply chain that anticipates and manages supply disruptions, backorders, and product recalls. Organizations should have a comprehensive supply chain strategy that addresses these key questions: Which substitute products could be used instead of current products? What are the best substitute suppliers and products to use? What lower- or equivalent-cost products, with equal or better effectiveness, would better serve the facility? If leaders do not have a robust system that addresses these questions, their supply chain could be at risk. Here are three recommendations for selecting safe substitutes. 1. Assess Inventory to Pinpoint Opportunities for Standardization Identifying clinically safe, acceptable substitutions for existing inventory is not only critical for navigating backorders, but can also be an effective tool in vendor negotiations. For instance, thousands of procedure kits are currently available. Finding one standard kit that meets a clinical care team’s needs and purchasing many kits can bolster negotiations with vendors, potentially resulting in better prices and savings opportunities for the organization. To minimize risks when standardizing to one vendor, keep relationships with an appropriate number of vendors and distributors and ensure that staff are using consistent products. Leaders should maintain a set inventory of substitute products that can be ordered when a supply disruption occurs or is anticipated. To build organizational alignment, it is important to include clinicians, nurses, supply chain leaders, and other healthcare personnel in the standardization decision-making process. Successful standardization begins by having quality data. With strong data, actionable analytics, and visibility into all aspects of the supply chain, organizations can make better decisions, improve operational efficiency, and improve the bottom line. Also,  standardization can help minimize variation in the quality of products and patient care, maximize contract compliance, reduce the number of stock-keeping units, and save money and time. 2. Establish Internal Protocols to Navigate Backorders in Advance of Disruption Over the last three years, healthcare organizations have had to adapt quicky to address challenges in an ever-changing environment. Supply-chain management has never been more important to healthcare providers. Building preparedness plans to ensure that an available stock of critical supplies has become even more critical. The plan should include testing supply availability in emergency preparedness plans and drills. Leaders should evaluate current inventory planning, materials management, and procurement processes and work closely with vendors and other supply- chain partners to develop processes to anticipate and prevent backorders and recalls. 3. Build a Plan for Assessment and Selection Many healthcare facilities encounter a common hurdle: the inability to objectively compare products based on vendor data and usage. When considering substitute products, organizations must carefully compare existing products with potential substitutes and collect independent, trustworthy data based on evidence. New products are released into the market regularly with purported  promises of clinical superiority over existing products, and clinician preference can also influence inventory decisions. Building a standard evaluation process that includes key performance indicators (KPIs) can help ensure that substitute products being considered are the right fit and meet product specification requirements and clinical, financial, and outcome expectations. KPIs are criteria used to evaluate critical areas of clinical and support functions that influence patient outcomes. With clear visibility to the KPIs used in compared products, purchasing managers and clinicians can collaborate to ensure they are making the best decisions on cost-effective, quality patient care.

Substitute goods are the goods that can be used in place of one another; however, Complementary goods are the goods that can be used together. It is essential to understand the relationship between substitute goods and complementary goods, especially for organisations and policymakers. It is so because the relationship between these goods helps businesses and policymakers in predicting consumer behaviour, setting prices, and developing marketing strategies. Geeky Takeaways: Substitute Goods are those goods which are used in place of one another to fulfill a specific need or want. For example, Coke and Coca-Cola. Complementary Goods are those goods which are used together to fulfill a specific need or want. For example, TV and remote. Cross Demand helps in determining the demand of a given commodity when the price of other related commodities changes. A commodity's demand is only affected by a change in the price of related goods and not the price of unrelated goods. Table of Content What are Substitute Goods? What are Complementary Goods? Difference between Substitute Goods and Complementary Goods What is Cross Demand? Cross Price Effect on Demand Curve What are Substitute Goods? The goods which can be used in place of one another to satisfy a specific want, like tea and coffee are known as Substitute Goods. The price of substitute goods directly affects the demand for a given commodity. For example, if the price of a substitute good (say, coffee) increases, then demand for the given commodity (say, tea) will increase as compared to coffee. In the above graph, the price of the substitute good (coffee) is shown on the Y-axis, and demand for the given commodity (tea) is shown on X-axis. When there is an increase in the price of coffee from OP to OP 1 , then the demand for tea will also increase from OQ to OQ 1 . What are Complementary Goods? The goods which are used together to satisfy a specific want, like bread and butter are known as Complementary Goods. The price of a complementary good and demand for the given commodity inversely relates to each other. For example, if the price of a complementary good (say, butter) increases, then demand for the given commodity (say, bread) will decrease as it will become costlier for the consumer to use both goods together. In the above graph, the price of the complementary good (butter) is shown on the Y-axis and demand for the given commodity (bread) is shown on X-axis. When there is an increase in the price of butter from OP to OP 1 , then the demand for bread will also increase from OQ to OQ 1 . Note: The above shown graphs are not demand curves. They only show the relationship between demand for a given commodity and price of the related good. Difference between Substitute Goods and Complementary Goods Basis Substitute Goods Complementary Goods Meaning The goods which can be used in place of one another to satisfy a specific want. The goods which are used together to satisfy a specific want. Nature of Demand Substitute goods have competitive demand. Complementary goods have joint demand. Slope The demand curve for substitute goods is upward sloping. The demand curve for complementary goods is downward sloping. Relation The price of one substitute good has a positive relationship with the quantity demanded of another substitute good. The price of one complementary good has a negative relationship with the quantity demanded of another complementary good. Example Pepsi and Coca-Cola, Tea and Coffee, etc. Bread and Butter, Tea and Sugar, etc. Demand is not affected by Change in Price of Unrelated Goods A commodity's demand is only affected by a change in the price of related goods (substitute goods and complementary goods). If there is a change in the price of unrelated goods, then there is no impact on the demand for a given commodity. Unrelated goods are the goods which are not linked with the demand for a given commodity. For example, if there is an increase/decrease in the price of bottle, then there will be no impact on the demand for laptop. What is Cross Demand? By keeping other things constant, the relationship between the demand for a given commodity and the price of related commodities is known as Cross Demand. In simple terms, cross demand helps in knowing how much quantity of a given commodity will be demanded at different price levels of a related commodity (substitute good or complementary good). Cross Demand can be expressed as: D x = f(P y ) Where, D x = Demand for the given commodity f = Functional Relationship P y = Price of the related commodity (substitute or complementary) Cross Demand can be either Positive or Negative In the case of substitute goods, cross demand is positive. It is because the demand for a given commodity varies directly with the prices of substitute goods. In the case of complementary goods, cross demand is negative. It is because the demand for a given commodity varies inversely with the prices of complementary goods. Cross Price Effect on Demand Curve The effect on the demand for a given commodity because of a change in the price of a related commodity is known as Cross Price Effect. In simple terms, the cross price effect originates from substitute goods and complementary goods. The effect of change in the prices of substitute goods and complementary goods can be explained as follows: A. Change in Price of Substitute Goods An increase or decrease in the price of substitute goods has a direct impact on the demand for a given commodity. 1. Increase in Price of Substitute Goods: When there is an increase in the price of substitute goods (say, coffee), the demand for the given commodity (say, tea) will also increase from OQ to OQ 1, with the same price OP. It results in a rightward shift in the demand curve of the given commodity (tea) from DD to D 1 D 1 . 2. Decrease in Price of Substitute Goods: When there is a decrease in the price of substitute goods (say, coffee), the demand for the given commodity (say, tea) will also decrease from OQ to OQ 1, with the same price OP. It results in a leftward shift in the demand curve of the given commodity (tea) from DD to D 1 D 1 . B. Change in Price of Complementary Goods An increase or decrease in the price of complementary goods has an inverse impact on the demand for a given commodity. 1. Increase in Price of Complementary Goods: When there is an increase in the price of complementary goods (say, butter), the demand for the given commodity (say, bread) will decrease from OQ to OQ 1, with the same price OP. It results in a leftward shift in the demand curve of the given commodity (bread) from DD to D 1 D 1 . 2. Decrease in Price of ",

A substitute product is a product from another industry that offers similar benefits to the consumer as the product produced by the firms within the industry. According to Porter’s 5 forces , threat of substitutes shapes the competitive structure of an industry. Download the External Analysis whitepaper to gain an advantage over competitors by overcoming obstacles and preparing to react to external forces, such as it being a buyer’s market. The threat of substitution in an industry affects the competitive environment for the firms in that industry and influences those firms’ ability to achieve profitability . The availability of a substitution threat effects the profitability of an industry because consumers can choose to purchase the substitute instead of the industry’s product . The availability of close substitute products can make an industry more competitive and decrease profit potential for the firms in the industry. On the other hand, the lack of close substitute products makes an industry less competitive and increases profit potential for the firms in the industry. A threat of substitutes example is the beverage industry due to a market with many competitors. Threat of Substitutes – Determining Factors Several factors determine whether or not there is a threat of substitute products in an industry. First, if the consumer’s switching costs are low, meaning there is little if anything stopping the consumer from purchasing the substitute instead of the industry’s product, then the threat of substitute products is high. Second, if the substitute product is cheaper than the industry’s product – thereby placing a ceiling on the price of the industry’s product – then a threat of substitutes high risk is the case. Third, if the substitute product is of equal or superior quality compared to the industry’s product, the threat of substitutes is high. And fourth, if the functions, attributes, or performance of the substitute product are equal or superior to the industry’s product. Any of these situations is a high threat of substitutes: porter’s 5 forces sees less profit potential. On the other hand, if the substitute is more expensive, of lower quality, its functionality does not compare with the industry’s product, and the consumer’s switching costs are high, then a low threat of substitutes occurs. And of course, if there is no close substitute for the industry’s product, then the threat of substitutes is low. [Threat of Substitutes – Analysis When analyzing a given industry, all of the aforementioned factors regarding the threat of substitutes may not apply. But some, if not many, certainly will. And of the factors that do apply, some may indicate high threat of substitutes and some may indicate low threat of substitute products. The results will not always be straightforward. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the nuances of the analysis and the particular circumstances of the given firm and industry when using these data to evaluate the competitive structure and profit potential of a market . The Threat of Substitutes Porter places High risk on: • Substitute product is cheaper than industry product • Consumer switching costs are low • Substitute product quality is equal or superior to industry product quality • Substitute performance is equal or superior to industry product performance The Porter Threat of Substitutes Low Risk Situation: • Consumer switching costs are high • Substitute product is more expensive than industry product • Consumer switching costs are high • Substitute product quality is inferior to industry product quality • Substitute performance is inferior to industry product performance • No substitute product is available Threat of Substitutes Interpretation A low threat of substitute products makes an industry more attractive. In addition, it increases profit potential for the firms in the industry. Conversely, a high threat of substitute products makes an industry less attractive. It also decreases profit potential for firms in the industry. The threat of substitute products is one of the factors to consider when analyzing the structural environment of an industry using Porter’s 5 forces framework. Start creating a list of potential substitutes that you evaluate as a threat in an external analysis .

In general, the more substitute products that are available to the customer, the more difficult it becomes for firms to raise their prices. The degree of difficulty will depend on how easily one product is substituted for another in the mind of the customer. Thus, the strength of competitive pressures from substitute products depends on three factors: Whether (1) substitute products are attractively priced and available; (2) buyers view the substitutes as comparable when analyzing price, quality, performance and other attributes; and (3) buyers can easily switch to substitutes. For example, cotton producers are in head-on competition with the makers of polyester fibers. Competitive pressure from this cotton substitute will increase as the price of polyester relative to cotton decreases, its characteristics are improved to match the more desirable characteristics of cotton and the user’s cost of switching from one product to the other is lowered. Unfortunately, in agriculture, many products are viewed as commodities with little brand distinction and low switching costs. Your Turn … List your cooperative’s products and services alongside substitute products and services. How closely are these products and services substituted for one another? Is there anything you can do to: (1) make it more difficult for customers to switch products to a substitute, or (2) differentiate your products and services (say through the addition of new features or characteristics), making them less comparable?

Is there a name for pairs of goods which are substitutes one way but not the other? As I understand it, a substitute good is one with a positive cross elasticity of demand, meaning that if the price of X rises, the demand for Y rises. As far as I can see, it is assumed that the reverse is always true - that if the price of Y rises the demand for X also rises. I don't think this is always true in practice. When I fly, I sometimes forget that toothpaste gets confiscated at security. Once through security I therefore sometimes have to buy extra toothpaste. I can either buy the toothpaste directly, or buy a 'traveller's washbag' which has toothpaste, toothbrush and deoderant (for example). I'm completely indifferent between the two options as I can just throw away the extra stuff in the washbag I don't need; the washbag perfectly substitutes for the toothpaste and I'll buy whichever is cheaper. Therefore should the price for toothpaste-alone rise, the demand for 'traveller's washbag' will also rise (there are plenty of reasons the price of toothpaste alone might rise without affecting the price of toothpaste-in-washbag, but for the sake of argument just assume this can happen) However this does not work in reverse; if I forget my washbag then a 'traveller's washbag' is the only good that will satisfy my needs. As the price of 'traveller's washbags' increases, the demand for toothpaste will remain completely static (let us suppose that you cannot buy deoderant on its own in this shop, and that your utility function is 0 if you can't perfectly clean yourself and 1 if you can) Is there any way to differentiate the toothpaste-washbag pair from, say, petrol-diesel or Coke-Pepsi which are more commonly used as examples of substitute goods?

Whether integrated or separate, firms have an incentive to introduce a bundling discount when demand for the bundle is elastic relative to demand for stand-alone products. When products are partial substitutes, this typically gives an integrated firm a greater incentive to offer a bundle discount (relative to the standard model with additive preferences), while product substitutability is often the sole reason why separate sellers wish to offer inter-firm discounts. When separate sellers negotiate their inter-firm discount, they can use the discount to relax competition.

In microeconomics , substitute goods are two goods that can be used for the same purpose by consumers. [ 1 ] That is, a consumer perceives both goods as similar or comparable, so that having more of one good causes the consumer to desire less of the other good. Contrary to complementary goods and independent goods , substitute goods may replace each other in use due to changing economic conditions. [ 2 ] An example of substitute goods is Coca-Cola and Pepsi ; the interchangeable aspect of these goods is due to the similarity of the purpose they serve, i.e. fulfilling customers' desire for a soft drink. These types of substitutes can be referred to as close substitutes. [ 3 ] Substitute goods are commodity which the consumer demanded to be used in place of another good. Economic theory describes two goods as being close substitutes if three conditions hold: [ 3 ] products have the same or similar performance characteristics products have the same or similar occasion for use and products are sold in the same geographic area Figure 1: If the price of x i {\\displaystyle x_{i}} increases, then demand for x j {\\displaystyle x_{j}} increases Performance characteristics describe what the product does for the customer; a solution to customers' needs or wants. [ 3 ] For example, a beverage would quench a customer's thirst. A product's occasion for use describes when, where and how it is used. [ 3 ] For example, orange juice and soft drinks are both beverages but are used by consumers in different occasions (i.e. breakfast vs during the day). Two products are in different geographic market if they are sold in different locations, it is costly to transport the goods or it is costly for consumers to travel to buy the goods. [ 3 ] Only if the two products satisfy the three conditions, will they be classified as close substitutes according to economic theory. The opposite of a substitute good is a complementary good, these are goods that are dependent on another. An example of complementary goods are cereal and milk. An example of substitute goods are tea and coffee. These two goods satisfy the three conditions: tea and coffee have similar performance characteristics (they quench a thirst), they both have similar occasions for use (in the morning) and both are usually sold in the same geographic area (consumers can buy both at their local supermarket). Some other common examples include margarine and butter , and McDonald's and Burger King . Formally, good x j {\\displaystyle x_{j}} is a substitute for good x i {\\displaystyle x_{i}} if when the price of x i {\\displaystyle x_{i}} rises the demand for x j {\\displaystyle x_{j}} rises, see figure 1. Let p i {\\displaystyle p_{i}} be the price of good x i {\\displaystyle x_{i}} . Then, x j {\\displaystyle x_{j}} is a substitute for x i {\\displaystyle x_{i}} if: ∂ x j ∂ p i > 0 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial x_{j}}{\\partial p_{i}}}>0} . Cross elasticity of demand [ edit ] The fact that one good is substitutable for another has immediate economic consequences: insofar as one good can be substituted for another, the demands for the two goods will be interrelated by the fact that customers can trade off one good for the other if it becomes advantageous to do so. Cross-price elasticity helps us understand the degree of substitutability of the two products. An increase in the price of a good will increase demand for its substitutes, while a decrease in the price of a good will decrease demand for its substitutes, see Figure 2. [ 4 ] Figure 2: Graphical example of substitute goods The relationship between demand schedules determines whether goods are classified as substitutes or complements. The cross-price elasticity of demand shows the relationship between two goods, it captures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good to a change in price of another good. [ 5 ] Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand ( E x,y ) is calculated with the following formula: E x,y = Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded for Good X / Percentage Change in Price of Good Y The cross-price elasticity may be positive or negative, depending on whether the goods are complements or substitutes. A substitute good is a good with a positive cross elasticity of demand. This means that, if good x j {\\displaystyle x_{j}} is a substitute for good x i {\\displaystyle x_{i}} , an increase in the price of x i {\\displaystyle x_{i}} will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of x i {\\displaystyle x_{i}} and cause the demand curve for x j {\\displaystyle x_{j}} to shift out . A decrease in the price of x i {\\displaystyle x_{i}} will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of x i {\\displaystyle x_{i}} and cause the demand curve for x j {\\displaystyle x_{j}} to shift in . Furthermore, perfect substitutes have a higher cross elasticity of demand than imperfect substitutes do. Types [ edit ] Figure 3: Utility functions of perfect substitutes Perfect and imperfect substitutes [ edit ] Perfect substitutes [ edit ] Perfect substitutes refer to a pair of goods with uses identical to one another. [ 6 ] In that case, the utility of a combination of the two goods is an increasing function of the sum of the quantity of each good. That is, the more the consumer can consume (in total quantity), the higher level of utility will be achieved, see figure 3. Perfect substitutes have a linear utility function and a constant marginal rate of substitution , see figure 3. [ 7 ] If goods X and Y are perfect substitutes, any different consumption bundle will result in the consumer obtaining the same utility level for all the points on the indifference curve (utility function). [ 8 ] Let a consumption bundle be represented by (X,Y), then, a consumer of perfect substitutes would receive the same level of utility from (20,10) or (30,0). Consumers of perfect substitutes base their rational decision-making process on prices only. Evidently, the consumer will choose the cheapest bundle to maximise their profits. [ 8 ] If the prices of the goods differed, there would be no demand for the more expensive good. Producers and sellers of perfect substitute goods directly compete with each other, that is, they are known to be in ",

What is it? Threat of Substitution Companies are concerned about the threat of substitute products (or services) displacing their own.  The threat of substitutes is high when rivals or even companies outside the industry offer more attractive and/or lower cost products.  Buyers then have the opportunity to make a price/performance trade-off. The cost of switching is also a factor; if it is high, the treat of substitution is low. Questions to Ask Is it easy for consumers to switch to another product/service? What are the major substitute products? What are the trends in market share of the product and its substitutes? What are the growth rates? What are the price/value characteristics? Are consumer preferences or consumer demographics changing? What are the Company's Products and Brands? Companies describe their business and list their business segments, products and brands in Item 1 of their 10-K report to the SEC.  Find the 10-K report on the company's website on the \"Investor Relations\" page or search the SEC's EDGAR database .

We’ve discussed the framework previously , but now we’re taking a more in-depth look at each individual force. Today, we’re looking at the threat of substitutes. Along with the threat of new entrants and competitive rivalry, the threat of substitutes is one of the three forces typically portrayed along a horizontal axis when Porter’s Five Forces are shown graphically . This is in contrast to supplier power and buyer power, which are portrayed vertically. This is to reflect the fact that new entrants, competitive rivalry and substitutes are forces that share the same market. The supplier of a substitute product is more likely to compete with you directly than one of your own suppliers or buyers. Substitutes differ in an important way from existing competitors and new entrants. Existing competitors and new entrants tend to compete more or less head-to-head. They may have a market position in a different niche, but they’re generally selling the same thing. A simple example is the pizza industry. A pizza parlor might position itself as a high-quality, upscale offering that is able to charge a premium because of its high quality. Its direct competitors — whether new or existing — could include a low-price pizza buffet. These businesses represent the dine-in pizza market. A substitute product would be carry-out pizza parlors or street vendors selling pizza by the slice. They sell a similar experience, but not the exact same thing. The important thing about substitutes is that they are similar enough to the primary offering that consumers are more or less indifferent between the primary offering and the substitute in terms of utility . Even though I might typically go for a dine-in experience, I’m still just as happy with a carry-out experience. When it comes to substitutes, it’s important to not think too narrowly. In our simple example, substitutes could also include other forms of junk food (no offense intended to the pizza industry). A fast-food hamburger chain could be a substitute for pizza. Similarly, a substitute could still focus on pizza but could be take-and-bake or frozen pizzas instead of ready-to-eat pizzas. A substitute could also be health food from a grocery store. Obviously each of the examples above may be more or less attractive to potential consumers than the primary industry for different reasons. Strategic CFO discusses four determining factors of the threat of substitutes . Switching Costs “If the consumer’s switching costs are low, meaning there is little if anything stopping the consumer from purchasing the substitute instead of the industry’s product, then the threat of substitute products is high.” This is not the same thing as price. Think of a contract with a cable company. You might be locked into a year-long term with a penalty if you decide to drop your service and switch to satellite. That’s a switching cost. Price “If the substitute product is cheaper than the industry’s product — thereby placing a ceiling on the price of the industry’s product — then a threat of substitutes high risk is the case.” In our hypothetical example above, if a cheap fast-food option like $1 burgers enters the market, some consumers will be less willing to pay $30 for a sit-down pizza dinner for two. It doesn’t mean nobody will, but some market share will almost certainly be lost. Quality “If the substitute product is of equal or superior quality compared to the industry’s product, the threat of substitutes is high.” Think of your own consumer behavior patterns. You may be quite happy with a particular product at a particular price point, but if a new product emerges that is of the same or higher quality, at the same or lower price, you’re likely to consider at least trying that new product. Similarity “If the functions, attributes, or performance of the substitute product are equal or superior to the industry’s product,” the threat of substitutes is high. This will depend on consumer tastes. Are hamburgers equal to or superior to pizza? What about health food from a grocery store that you have to cook yourself? It’s important to remember that substitutes can be close substitutes or distant substitutes. But a substitute doesn’t have to be close to draw business away from an industry, and there are almost always multiple substitutes. One of the reasons we used the example of the dine-in pizza industry in this case is that it has a high threat of substitutes, meaning it lends itself easily to examples. Porter’s isn’t just a theoretical model. It has practical applicability for business people in any industry or field. As you think about the impact of substitutes, consider the types of substitutes that might exist—or might emerge—to compete with your products and services. These considerations should be part of an ongoing process of environmental scanning to help forecast and identify potential risks that must be addressed to ensure your business remains viable and competitive. How might these considerations help you position your products and services more competitively?

You will come across these when you cover cross price elasticity of demand in introductory microeconomics. Substitutes and Complements Substitute goods Substitute goods are two alternative goods that could be used for the same purpose. They are goods that are in competitive demand A rise in the prices of Good S will lead to a contraction in demand for Good S This might then cause some consumers to switch to a rival product Good T This is because the relative price of Good T has fallen The cross-price elasticity of demand for two substitutes is positive Examples of substitute goods: Tea and coffee Smartphone Brands Rival ride sharing apps Competing supermarket chains Online streaming platforms Cereal brands Evaluation points on substitutes: Always consider the cost of substitution – there might be switching costs for consumers if they opt for a new brand Some products are close substitutes with a high (positive) cross price elasticity of demand Others are weaker substitutes especially when consumer/brand loyalty is high Complement goods Complementary goods are products which are bought and used together A fall in the price of Good X will lead to an expansion in quantity demand for X And this might then lead to higher demand for the complement Good Y Complements are said to be in joint demand The cross-price elasticity of demand for two complements is negative Examples of complement goods: Fish and chips Smartphones and apps Solar panels & batteries Flights and taxi services Shoes and polish Pasta and pasta sauces Complement goods and product bundling Businesses understand that complements are bought together Product bundling is to offer bundles of products sold together at an attractive discount Share : Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share by Email Economics Reference Topic Videos Substitutes Invisible Hand Cross-price elasticity of demand Complements Joint Demand You might also like Price elasticity of demand (Revision Presentation) Teaching PowerPoints Explaining Price Elasticity of Demand and Total Revenue Topic Videos Explaining Price Elasticity of Supply Study Notes Britain's biscuit shortage 6th March 2016 Different Types of Demand Topic Videos The Universal Stylus Initiative - markets and complementary products 31st January 2018 Introduction to Economics and the Operations of Markets - take the Yes/No challenge Quizzes & Activities IB Economics - The Nature of Markets Study Notes Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Our subjects Our Subjects › Business › Criminology › Economics › Geography › Health & Social Care › History › Law › Politics › Psychology › Sociology Explore Explore › Teaching & learning resources › Student revision workshops › Online student courses › CPD for teachers › Livestreams › Teaching jobs Contact Contact Boston House, 214 High Street, Boston Spa, West Yorkshire, LS23 6AD Tel: 01937 848885 › Contact us › Terms of use › Privacy & cookies © 2002-2025 Tutor2u Limited.

Can you guide us how will we be able to carry forward that functionality further so that the pickers on ground level will get to know whether that customer has ticked or unticked. Iris March 29, 2022, 11:26am 2 Hi @Love2shop , That’s a great question. To provide the best guidance possible, let me better understand the situation. Do you intentionally allow overselling out-of-stock products, and in what scenario? If not, you can always untick this option for any existing products. That way, a customer won’t be able to order sold out products in the first place. But when that happens, you can offer a related product of interest to them and capture that sale using an app called Alternative, Related Products . Most Shopify themes allow you to enable ‘order notes’ so you can collect extra details from customers for each order they place. Here’s a page on Shopify’s help docs with more details. If you’re comfortable editing code, here’s a forum link for a tutorial on adding cart attributes to your store’s theme. This is an advanced tutorial, and knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Liquid is required. Consider hiring a Shopify Expert if you aren’t comfortable doing the steps in the tutorial. Finally, you can check out some apps on the App Store that have a built-in feature for cart attributes. Find the complete list of available apps here . I hope this helps! automatethis June 3, 2025,  9:26pm 3 Hey! That’s a great idea—especially if your team is doing local fulfillment. We just launched an app called Substitutions that lets you define which SKUs can automatically swap in when something goes out of stock. While the app doesn’t include a pre-ticked box at checkout by default, you can add that using Shopify’s cart attributes and tie it to order tags or notes for your team to reference. Let me know if you want to explore that setup. —Ahmed from Substitutions Related topics Topic Replies Views Activity Out of stock SKU's visible as such yet able to add them to cart Shopify Discussion shop-performance 5 0 September 18, 2023 How to add a customer choice selection option in online grocery?

For instance, if the price of one product increases, consumers may opt for a substitute that is cheaper or more accessible. This means that substitute goods can be seen as similar products that can serve the same purpose or function. For instance, the iPhone and Galaxy Note can be considered substitutes since they both act as mobile phones. In this way, they provide consumers with different options to fulfill the same need. Key Points A substitute good is defined as a product or service that is used in place of another. When the price of one substitute good goes up, the demand for the other substitute also goes up – this is known as positive cross price elasticity. Substitute goods are highly competitive as they can be easily replaced by a competitor. Substitute goods are important for maintaining a competitive environment, which helps to keep prices down and quality up. When the price of one good increases, the demand for a substitute good tends to increase as well. For example, if the price of McDonald’s Big Mac increases from $9 to $15, customers may choose to purchase a burger from Burger King for $9 instead. This ensures that businesses cannot simply raise prices without consequence and must remain competitive in order to retain their customer base. Substitute Goods Examples There exist two types of substitute goods, namely direct and indirect substitutes. A direct substitute is a scenario where two commodities can be interchanged without difficulty, such as Pepsi and Cola. On the other hand, an indirect substitute is a situation where two goods can be replaced by each other, but with a low level of correlation. An instance of this would be bowling and dancing. In case the customer’s dance class is cancelled, they might decide to enjoy a game of bowling instead. However, it is worth noting that these two products are not typically utilized as replacements for one another. Having said that, let us now examine a few examples. Direct Substitute Examples Pepsi and Coca-Cola McDonalds and Burger King Playstation and Xbox Supermarket-branded and Branded products Transport by Car or Train iPhone and Samsung Galaxy Pizza Hut and Domino’s Physical Books and Kindle In-direct Substitute Examples Dancing and bowling Bowling and Video games Banana and Doughnuts Direct Substitute Goods Goods that are classified as direct substitutes possess a high level of similarity and have many common characteristics. For instance, Coca-Cola and Pepsi are direct substitutes in the soda market. They are also known as ‘within-category substitutes’ or ‘close substitutes’. “Direct Substitutes share many common characteristics, but most importantly, consumers readily switch between the two.” Direct substitute goods have a characteristic known as high cross-elasticity of demand . This means that two products can be easily interchanged. For example, there may be a branded bag of flour and an own-branded one. Customers’ preferences may be heavily influenced by any changes in variables, particularly price. In particular, direct substitute goods exhibit a high cross-elasticity of demand . If the price of Coca-Cola increases and its sales drop by 10 percent, then the sales of Pepsi may rise by approximately 10 percent. In other words, when there is a significant correlation between the two goods, they can be regarded as direct substitute goods. In-direct Substitute Goods Indirect substitute goods can arise from industries or categories that appear to be unrelated. For instance, if the price of bowling increases, some customers may opt to purchase more video games instead. Although these products come from different industries and are different in nature, a portion of consumers may readily substitute one for the other. Indirect substitute goods typically have a low cross-elasticity of demand . For example, a customer might go to a store to buy a doughnut, but if none are available, they may decide to purchase a banana instead. These two items are entirely different, yet they can still be substituted for one another. Since indirect substitutes are not very common, they tend to have a weak correlation, which results in a low cross-elasticity of demand. For instance, if the price of bowling increases and its sales decline by 10 percent, the increase in video game sales may only be around 1 percent. The relationship between the two products is therefore feeble. Nevertheless, it is crucial for marketers to take this into account. Factors that affect Substitute Goods The illustration below demonstrates that when McDonald’s raises its prices, the demand for Burger King increases. However, it is important to note that price is not the only variable to consider when assessing the power of substitution. There are various other factors that come into play. Substitute goods fulfill consumer needs when there is a change in a particular variable. Various factors such as price, quality, and geography can come into play. If any of these factors change, substitute goods can become relevant. For instance, you may typically purchase a freshly made doughnut from a local bakery every day. However, one day the quality of the doughnut decreases, and it becomes dry and tasteless. In such a scenario, you might consider substituting it with other options such as cakes, waffles, or any other similar products. Any item that is purchased instead of the doughnut can be regarded as a substitute good. Why Consumers Choose Substitutes Consumers choose substitutes for a number of reasons. Let us look at some of them below: 1. Price Price is perhaps the most common reason why customers consider substituting goods. For instance, in a restaurant, a pint of beer may cost $10 while a cola may cost $3. In such a scenario, the customer would need to believe that the beer is worth an additional $7 to them. Each individual places a certain value on each product, and they make their decision based on their preference for one product over the other. These decisions are often made subconsciously. 2. Quantity Quantity and supply can also impact consumers’ decisions to purchase substitute goods. For instance, if the last iced-ringed doughnut is sold out at the local grocery store, customers may look for substitute goods instead. 3. Quality Quality is another factor that can influence the demand for substitute goods. If a product does not taste good, does not last long, or is not comfortable, customers may consider other options. For example, there may be a run-down restaurant around the corner that produces food that is okay, but the lower quality is taken into account alongside pricing. 4. Geography Geography is also a crucial variable to consider when purchasing substitute goods. There may be two supermarkets; one that is on the way home from work, and another that is 15 minutes out",

While many leaders can control their companies’ internal operations, there’s often little they can do to ensure the economy, political landscape, and competition act and react in their favor. For this reason, preparation is essential in business. Whether through complements or substitutes, the right business strategy can rapidly make an impact.

Qualitatively, two products are said to be substitutable if a customer can replace one product by the other, while they are complementary if they tend to be bought together. In this article, we take a network perspective to help automatically identify complements and substitutes from sales transaction data. Starting from a bipartite product-purchase network representation, with both transaction nodes and product nodes, we develop appropriate null models to infer significant relations, either complements or substitutes, between products, and design measures based on random walks to quantify their importance. The resulting unipartite networks between products are then analysed with community detection methods, in order to find groups of similar products for the different types of relationships. The results are validated by combining observations from a real-world basket dataset with the existing product hierarchy, as well as a large-scale flavour compound and recipe dataset. 1 Introduction Understanding the hidden relations existing between products is fundamental in both economics and marketing research as well as in retail [ 1 ]. This question lies at the core of market structure analysis and finds numerous applications. Retailers must regularly make decisions taking product relationships into account [ 2 ], for instance to design their product catalogue and to determine the number of products to offer in each category [ 3 ]. Brick-and-mortar retailers seek to identify the best way to arrange the product layout in aisles and stock their shelves [ 4 ], and online retailers also strive to optimise the grouping of products in their online shops [ 5 ]. Furthermore, they must decide which products to bundle or promote together. These assortment-related decisions have significant influence on customers’ choices, sales of products, and finally, profits [ 2 , 3 , 6 ]. Complements and substitutes are two central concepts to characterise relationships between products, with well-established definitions in economics [ 7 ]. Complementary products are sold separately but used together, each creating a demand for the other, such as hot dogs and hot dog buns. Substitute products serve the same purpose and can be used in place of one another, such as Brand A tomatoes and Brand B tomatoes. In the economics literature, the degree of complementarity (substitutability) is formally defined through the negative (positive) cross-price elasticity of demand, where the rise in the demand of one product is recorded after the price of the other product is reduced (increased) by a unit. The mechanisms of complements and substitutes are also referred to as the halo effect and demand transfer , respectively, in the retail context [ 8 ]. Despite its practical importance, the algorithmic problem of identifying the relationship between products in retail is not well known. For a long time, researchers and practitioners have selected the set of possible complementary or substitute products by means of, for instance, field expertise and simple statistics, and the analysis has usually been restricted to a fairly small number of products [ 9 , 10 ]. Recent development and application of natural language processing and machine learning (ML) algorithms, especially those based on word embedding, bring in new visions and opportunities, which makes it possible to analyse thousands of products [ 11 – 13 ]. These methods use the transactions, some require customer information, as the original feature space, and apply ML algorithms to essentially reduce the dimension of these feature vectors. The resulting embeddings can then be used to identify the relationship between products and also in customer choice models. However, there are several limitations in these applications. Firstly, the interpretation of the selected features in the related ML algorithms is difficult. This makes it challenging to develop metrics in this space, in particular to verify the property of triangle inequality, and further use metric invariants to define measures between products. In practice, these methods often rely on the definition of similarity measures (not necessarily metrics) for complementarity and exchangeability Footnote 1 [ 12 , 13 ]. Secondly, these methods lack specific criteria to determine whether two products are complements, substitutes, or just independent, despite trying to quantify the effects by their similarities. Thirdly, they do not explore the connection between complements and substitutes, which is of great significance to improve the understanding of the relationships and their further applications. Furthermore, these methods are based on co-purchase patterns, but the other valuable information in the sales data remains unused. In our study, we propose an alternative to the classic approach based on cross-price elasticity, and take instead a network perspective in order to define complementarity and substitutability between products. As a starting point, we model the sales data as a bipartite product-purchase network , with both transactions (or baskets) and products as nodes. We then perform our analysis directly on the network, without having to rely on low-dimensional embeddings which may lead to uncontrolled loss of information. We use the connectivity patterns between products to characterise complements and substitutes. To do so, we define null models on the bipartite network to determine significant relationships between products, and propose measures induced by random walks on networks to quantify the intensity of these relationships. This approach can be seen as a generalisation of the classic bipartite network projection where we focus on different notions of connectivity induced by the bipartite structure. We also take an initial step to explicitly incorporate noise effects in our measures. As we show later, the resulting projections onto unipartite networks, based both on complementary and substitute connections, allow us to find groups of similar products with standard tools like community detection. The aim of our work is to provide insights into product relationships from a network perspective with simple assumptions, and to further extract both complements and substitutes efficiently from easily accessible sales data. It is our belief that a network approach opens up a promising new angle on this problem due to its flexibility, e.g. in determining significant relationships, and the vast network science toolbox. The insights derived from our methods have applications in assortment-related decision making, not only for retailers but also general firms with long product lines. Furthermore, our set of methods can also be applied to other contexts, such as trading networks, ecological systems and social networks, where both the identification of cooperative and competitive relations are of interest. 2 Data In this section, we present the different datasets that we use to perform our analysis, the sales data in Sect. 2.1 to extract the product relationships, the product h",

Previous Section Table of Contents Next Section 3.5 Independent, Complement, and Substitute Goods and Services Most of the action in business involves not just the product line, but also the markets for related products and services. There are three key concepts related to product and service differentiation and the type of related goods being offered; they are independent, substitute , and complementary goods and services. Two goods are independent Products with consumption or use that are not related. if their consumption or use is not related. The use of toothbrushes, for example, is not related to the consumption or use of motorcycles. Independent goods are goods that are not dependent in any way on how the other good is used. Since demand for one does not affect the demand for the other, product differentiation has little impact on these types of product trade-offs. Much of the interesting economic activity in terms of strategy and differentiation comes from complementary and substitute products and services. Complementary goods Goods typically used together. When the demand for one complement increases, the demand for the other good increases as well. are typically used together. When the demand for one rises, for example, burgers, it leads to a rise in demand for the other product, for example, fries. Examples of complementary products and services include toothbrushes and toothpaste, PCs and monitors, travel services and global positioning systems, console game systems and broadband demand, and operating systems and business applications suites. In the case of Joanâs jewelry boxes, a complementary good would be an expensive wood polish to maintain the wood or perhaps a limited line of earrings that could be placed in the jewelry box as part of a gift. Substitute goods Interchangeable goods with equivalent functions. When the demand for one substitute increases, the demand for the other good decreases. are goods that are alike. In other words, substitute goods have an equivalent function and one substitute good can be consumed or used in place of another. They are largely interchangeable and when the demand for one substitute increases, the demand for the other good decreases. Examples of substitute services include cable systems and satellite systems. Although they work very differently, they can be effectively substituted for one another. Other examples include margarine and butter, satellite phones and cell phones, powdered and liquid laundry detergent, and CDs and MP3 files. None of these products are actually perfect substitutes because they all have slightly different features and have different performance characteristics. A perfect substitute works essentially the same way and has the same features and qualities as another technology. In practice, many competing technologies are imperfect substitutes. MP3 files are imperfect substitutes for CDs because CDs produce better sound than MP3 files. However, MP3 files are smaller and more easily copied than CDs. Butter and margarine are slightly differentiated in terms of taste and the way our bodies assimilate these two fats. In the case of Joanâs jewelry boxes, product substitutes would be any jewelry box or container that could be used to house jewelry. This would include a plastic food storage container, a vase, or even a glass. Previous Section Table of Contents Next Section",

Ask Question Asked 9 years, 4 months ago Modified 9 years, 3 months ago Viewed 2k times 3 $\\begingroup$ Especially in consumer electronics, a large number of goods are offered only in some countries. Usually this holds only for products which have some close substitutes available (e.g., screens, where a particularly cheap models are often only sold in the U.S. but not in Europe). Such cases are not too hard to explain via price discrimination. However, I recently found out that there exist products which do not have close substitutes such as Sony's E-Ink readers but are nonetheless only available in some countries. (Production limitations were my first thought, but the example product is already several years old.) Given that the online retailer market is very efficient and that consumer electronics have large development costs I could not come up with a reason why consumer electronics producers would willingly restrict their own market size. Since I do not believe that producers make such decisions without good reasons, I would like to know what these reasons are. Note that the example product is not the only case, similar cases can be found earlier in the cell phone and PC markets. international-economics producer-theory Share Improve this question Follow asked Mar 17, 2016 at 7:45 HRSE HRSE 1,882 10 10 silver badges 29 29 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment | 2 Answers 2 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) 2 $\\begingroup$ One way to look at this is through the idea of \"fixed costs\". It only makes sense to pay the fixed cost if the market is big enough. There is very likely a large a fixed cost of entering a market. You have to establish a network of retailers or at least distribution channels, a way for the customers to return the defective units, partners that will also supply the covers, the software, the adapters, etc. Often you have to register the devices with the local regulators, they have to approve them for sale in that country, etc. From the marketing perspective there are also fixed costs. You make a single advertisement campaign per country, and you use it everywhere in that country. I suppose there is a minimum word of mouth effect that needs to take place for any marketing to be available, so I suppose a small marketing campaign is unlikely to be efficient. Also, sometimes products are sold or presented basically as flagship products, or loss-leaders, to call attention to the technological prowess of a firm, but not because they are all profitable. So, if a brand does not face a lot of competition in a country, it might not introduce these products as selling them, might actually represent a marketing expenditure.

Sony has a distribution network in many countries and makes almost no marketing for the E-ink reader in the United States. At least one of their US distributors sells other products worldwide, but is apparently forced to sell the reader only in the U.S. The fixed costs of development of an electronic device seem very large compared to registering the device with a regulator. While your answer may apply to some products, in the given example I am still puzzled... $\\endgroup$ – HRSE Commented Mar 20, 2016 at 2:42 $\\begingroup$ Yes, there are probably other things going on. Somethign that is harder to develop in the case of E-readers is the e-book infrastructure of editorial distribution rights, copyrights, etc. Some countries do not have a legal framework updated for this kind of thing. $\\endgroup$ – Fix.B. Commented Mar 29, 2016 at 18:26 Add a comment | 1 $\\begingroup$ I would guess large barriers to entry for doing business in different countries: Differing laws, need new suppliers, more uncertain demand (less knowledge of customers and consumption habits). In less developed countries, possibility of seizure of assets.

Companies are concerned that substitute products or services may displace their own. The threat of substitution is high when rivals, or companies outside the industry, offer more attractive and/or lower cost products. Buyers then have the opportunity to make a performance/price trade-off. The cost of switching is also a factor. If it is high, the threat of substitution is low. Questions to ask include: Is it easy for consumers to switch to another product/service? What are the major substitute products? What are the trends in market share of the product and its substitutes? What are the growth rates? What are the price/value characteristics?
