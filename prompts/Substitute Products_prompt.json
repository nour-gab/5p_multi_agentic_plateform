  "strategy": "The DeepCrawlerAgent will execute targeted searches focusing on potential substitutes for blockchain-based solutions within the FinTech sector over the last 6-12 months. The strategy involves identifying traditional financial services that have significantly digitized, as well as emerging non-DLT technologies like advanced AI (especially agentic AI) or sophisticated centralized systems offering competitive advantages in areas typically addressed by blockchain (e.g., security, efficiency, transparency). The agent will analyze industry reports, news articles, regulatory updates on CBDCs, and company announcements to pinpoint innovations that could displace or diminish the need for blockchain in areas like payments, identity, or asset management. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the capabilities, market penetration, and value propositions of these alternative solutions.",
