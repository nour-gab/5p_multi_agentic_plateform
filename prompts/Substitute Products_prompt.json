  "strategy": "The DeepCrawlerAgent will focus on identifying emerging technologies, alternative service models, and non-traditional players that offer similar or superior value propositions to existing FinTech solutions. The crawling strategy involves leveraging the high-impact keywords to search for recent market reports, industry analyses, news articles, and competitive landscape assessments (last 6-12 months). The agent will prioritize sources discussing adoption rates, user shifts, and investment trends in substitute technologies like Decentralized Finance (DeFi), embedded finance, and Big Tech's financial ventures. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the convenience, cost-effectiveness, and regulatory implications of these substitutes to gauge their threat level to established FinTech products.",
