  "strategy": "The DeepCrawlerAgent will focus on identifying the key determinants of buyer power within the blockchain-enabled FinTech sector, especially where agentic AI is involved. The strategy involves comprehensive crawling for data on customer adoption rates, perceived value, and the friction points (switching costs) associated with blockchain-based financial services. It will prioritize recent market research reports, user sentiment analysis, and competitive landscape assessments from the last 6-12 months. The agent will seek to understand how well new FinTech solutions leveraging blockchain and AI meet buyer needs versus traditional or alternative options, assessing their ability to dictate terms, influence pricing, and switch providers with ease.",
