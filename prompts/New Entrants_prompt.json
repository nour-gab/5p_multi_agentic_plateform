  "strategy": "The DeepCrawlerAgent will initiate targeted searches using FinTech-specific keywords, prioritizing recent data (last 6-12 months) to identify emerging players and market entry dynamics. It will leverage external APIs like Crunchbase and CB Insights to gather intelligence on recent funding rounds, startup launches, and growth trajectories. The strategy includes analyzing regulatory changes, such as new licensing frameworks or sandbox initiatives, that significantly impact market accessibility. The agent will identify common barriers to entry (e.g., capital requirements, compliance complexities, brand trust) and evaluate the strategies new entrants employ to overcome them, including technological innovation, niche targeting, and strategic partnerships with established players. The goal is to comprehensively map the landscape of potential new competitors and understand their pathways to market penetration.",
