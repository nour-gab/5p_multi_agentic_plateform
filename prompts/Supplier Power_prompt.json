  "strategy": "The DeepCrawlerAgent will execute targeted searches using the provided keywords to assess the bargaining power of key suppliers within the FinTech sector. The strategy involves identifying dominant cloud infrastructure providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP), specialized API and data vendors (e.g., payment gateways, identity verification, market data), and critical RegTech/cybersecurity solution providers. The agent will prioritize recent analyst reports, industry news, vendor partnership announcements, and M&A activities from the last 6-12 months to understand supplier concentration, pricing trends, and the switching costs for FinTech firms. The goal is to identify potential bottlenecks, dependency risks, and the overall influence of these suppliers on FinTech operational costs, innovation capacity, and time-to-market.",
