  "strategy": "The DeepCrawlerAgent will focus on identifying and assessing the bargaining power of critical suppliers to the FinTech industry. The strategy involves targeting search results from the last 6-12 months using the provided keywords. Initial crawls will prioritize reputable industry analyses, financial news outlets, and technology vendor reports to uncover market share, dependency levels, and pricing trends among key infrastructure, data, and service providers. Special attention will be paid to cloud computing providers, specialized API platforms (e.g., payments, BaaS), cybersecurity solutions, and regulatory technology (RegTech) vendors. The agent will analyze content for indicators of supplier concentration, switching costs for FinTech firms, and any recent supply chain disruptions or M&A activities involving these critical suppliers. This will provide a comprehensive view of how supplier dynamics influence FinTech operational costs and strategic flexibility.",
