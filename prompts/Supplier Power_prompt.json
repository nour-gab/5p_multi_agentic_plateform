  "strategy": "The DeepCrawlerAgent will target key suppliers to the FinTech industry, specifically those enabling blockchain and agentic AI applications. Using targeted keywords like \"Blockchain infrastructure providers FinTech\" and \"AI model APIs decentralized finance,\" the agent will identify companies offering critical services such as cloud computing, data provision, oracle networks, smart contract auditing, and specialized AI/Web3 development tools. The crawling strategy will prioritize recent data (last 6-12 months) from tech news outlets, industry reports, company press releases, and investment analyses to assess supplier concentration, unique service offerings, and potential switching costs. This approach aims to uncover dependencies, potential supply chain risks, and the bargaining power held by these technology enablers over FinTech firms leveraging distributed ledger technologies and advanced AI.",
