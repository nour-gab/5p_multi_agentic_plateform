### **DeepCrawler Agent: Market & Ecosystem Crawl Strategy**

**Porter Force**: Rivalry
**Project Idea / Business Context**: blockchain market analysis using agentic ai

**1. Focused Data Acquisition and Crawling Strategy**

**Objective**: To identify, benchmark, and analyze the competitive landscape among existing players in the blockchain FinTech space, particularly those leveraging or enabling agentic AI, or those who could be direct/indirect competitors to an agentic AI solution for blockchain market analysis. The focus will be on their market share, innovation, funding, M&A activities, product strategies, and user growth within the last 6-12 months.

**Phased Approach**:

*   **Phase 1: Landscape Mapping & Competitor Identification (Broad)**
    *   **Goal**: Identify key players in the FinTech blockchain space and emerging entities in agentic AI for finance.
    *   **Method**: Utilize broad search queries across Tavily (web search for recent news, reports), Crunchbase/CB Insights (funding, company profiles), and initial scans of major financial news feeds.
*   **Phase 2: Deep Dive Competitive Analysis (Targeted)**
    *   **Goal**: Gather granular data on identified competitors' product offerings, market share, user growth, technological advancements, funding, M&A, partnerships, and strategic initiatives.
    *   **Method**: Leverage specific company lookups in Crunchbase/CB Insights, targeted news searches via Tavily/Gemini, SEC EDGAR (for public companies), and relevant blockchain analytics APIs.
*   **Phase 3: Trend & Innovation Monitoring (Continuous)**
    *   **Goal**: Monitor for new disruptive technologies, market shifts, and competitive moves (e.g., pricing wars, new product launches) that could alter the rivalry landscape.
    *   **Method**: Set up alerts on news feeds and regularly re-evaluate top search queries.
*   **Validation & Filtering (Gemini-based & Cosine Similarity)**:
    *   For every retrieved document/article, extract key entities and concepts.
    *   Generate embeddings (vector representations) using Gemini's text models for the document content and for core query concepts (e.g., "FinTech rivalry," "blockchain market analysis," "agentic AI").
    *   Calculate **cosine similarity** between document embeddings and concept embeddings. Documents with similarity scores below a pre-defined threshold (e.g., 0.65) will be filtered out as low relevance.
    *   Utilize Gemini for **sentiment analysis** on news articles pertaining to specific competitors or market events (e.g., positive outlook on a company's growth, negative sentiment regarding a failed product launch). This informs "signal strength."
    *   **Signal Strength Ranking**: Prioritize sources based on authority (e.g., reputable financial news, research firms, regulatory bodies) and recency (last 6-12 months being highest priority).
*   **Performance Optimization**:
    *   **Caching**: Implement a temporary local cache for frequently accessed API responses (e.g., company profiles) to minimize redundant calls and adhere to API limits.
    *   **Dynamic Query Refinement**: Based on initial top results, dynamically refine subsequent queries to narrow down or expand scope as needed.
    *   **Parallel Execution (Simulated)**: Imagine parallelizing search queries across different tools where feasible (e.g., searching Tavily for news while querying Crunchbase for company financials).
